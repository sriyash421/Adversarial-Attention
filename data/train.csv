692,The tension in the crowd was broken with a burst of applause after the 5 million mark and a louder explosion at 6 million,3.3,3.2,3.2

697,The auction attendance was swelled by coin collectors who had gathered on the eve of the American Numismatic Association Convention the largest coin show of the year expected to draw more than 10000 people to the Marriott Marquis Hotel Wednesday,3.1,3.3,3.3
698,So the auction was almost like the ribboncutting ceremony for the convention Stack said,3.25,2.75,3.12

700,because it is one of a kind it is beautiful and it has a great story,3.8,3.5,3.2
701,The coin was the only 1933 double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale and its Maltese Falconesque history only recently came to light thanks to documents unearthed during the fiveyear legal battle over its ownership,3.2,3.0,3.1
702,In 1792 it was deemed that all gold and silver US coins would bear the depiction of an eagle but gold pieces were issued only after a gold rush boom in 1850,3.12,2.5,3.25
703,They were called double eagles because their face value was twice that of the original 10 gold piece,3.11,3.0,3.0

710,But before these coins came to light the royal legation of Egypt turned up with one at the Department of the Treasury and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the collection of King Farouk,3.0,2.67,3.0

715,The coin once again escaped destruction when it was moved from the Treasury Department vault in 7 World Trade Center eight months before the building collapsed after the Sept 11 terrorist attack,2.89,3.0,3.0

722,Following are excerpts from the findings of the Senate Ethics Committees report on Sen Robert G Torricellis dealings with David Chang,3.0,2.86,3.0
723,Your acceptance of a television and stereo CD player upon payment from David Chang of an amount you understood to be the cost to Mr Chang rather than fair market retail value evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rules 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules,2.5,3.3,3.3
724,The Ethics Committee was unconvinced,2.7,2.7,3.1
725,Continuation of a personal and official relationship with Mr Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years when you and your Senate Office were taking official actions of benefit to Mr Chang contacting United States Government officials writing letters to foreign government officials and involving Mr Chang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign governments evidenced poor judgment,2.6,2.7,3.0
726,troubled by incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Chang,2.6,3.0,3.0
727,The committee has also considered that the principal source of the allegations against you is David Chang a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the Department of Justice a United States district judge and his own conduct,2.8,2.9,2.9
728,In court documents the government noted that Chang could not be trusted,2.6,3.1,2.8
729,On May 23 2002 Mr Chang was convicted of attempting to corruptly persuade a witness to give false testimony a conspiracy to violate the federal election law and four violations of the federal election law,2.9,3.0,3.0
730,After evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony the committee is troubled by incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Mr Chang,2.78,3.11,3.11
731,Therefore the committee expresses its determination that your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance of impropriety and you are hereby severely admonished,2.4,3.3,3.1
732,Further the committee notes section 1c1 of the Senate Gift Rule 35 concerning anything which is paid for at market value or returned as well as your commitment to pay for any item which the committee might conclude were in violation of the rules and has further concluded that you must pay Chang an amount sufficient to bring the total to fair market retail value of the TV and CD player as well as the fair market retail value of the earrings given to the three individuals at your home with appropriate interest,2.9,2.7,3.0
733,The committee criticized Torricelli for maintaining a personal and official relationship with Chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years,2.8,3.0,3.1

749,Thus most of the facts presented are a matter of record,3.0,2.9,2.9
750,And Time magazine actually called his resume not his life an American dream but it also followed that up with a reference to his life saying he was one of six children and raised on welfare,2.88,3.25,2.75
751,The advertisement attempts to make several points and reach several different constituencies,3.2,3.1,3.1
752,For one it counters the high name recognition of Andrew M Cuomo McCalls opponent by offering voters a straightforward introduction to the candidate emphasizing his long list of highlevel jobs in both the public and private sector,3.0,2.62,3.12
753,It also emphasizes leadership an important campaign issue after Sept 11,3.17,3.33,3.17
754,At the same time it gives McCall a chance to intertwine his bootstraps story with the broader issue of children and education a priority of many Democratic voters,2.89,3.0,3.11

764,While all five members of the majority found the instructions to the jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be confusing two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that the prosecutors statements in his summation about the defenses expert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument,2.88,2.87,3.25
765,The committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations including Changs claim that he gave Torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash,2.6,3.2,2.8

779,President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt describes himself as Americas leading Arab ally,3.0,2.8,2.9
780,Yet his antidemocratic behavior is an embarrassment to Washington and an affront to his own people,2.8,3.2,2.9
781,The latest example is Mondays resentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim a sociologist and human rights activist to seven years in prison for his efforts to register voters monitor elections and report attacks on Egypts Coptic Christians,2.4,2.8,3.0
782,Ibrahim who holds dual United States and Egyptian citizenship is 63 years old and ailing,3.0,3.0,3.1
783,Ibrahims harsh punishment sends a chilling message to Egyptians yearning for a more accountable and tolerant society,2.7,3.4,3.2
784,That is especially true of the State Security Court that ruled in this case,3.0,2.83,3.17
785,Nor is it likely his sentence would have been reaffirmed if Mubarak believed that convicting an American citizen for promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own standing with the Bush administration and the 2 billion annual American subsidy that keeps his government afloat,2.8,3.2,2.9
786,That aid bonanza was granted to reward Mubaraks predecessor Anwar Sadat for signing a peace treaty with Israel,3.33,3.0,3.11
787,Washington has never demanded good governance and democracy from Cairo in return,2.4,3.2,3.2
788,In recent months President Bush has spoken of the need to promote democracy in the Arab world,3.2,3.0,3.2
789,But so far he has pushed the point only with the Palestinians,2.88,2.75,3.0
790,It is time to extend this policy to Egypt,3.0,3.0,3.0
791,It is a country with a long and glorious history a substantial middle class a peace treaty with Israel and large quantities of American aid,3.22,3.11,3.22
792,Under Mubarak it has squandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly stifled political debate,2.71,3.14,2.86
793,Its official media are awash in antiAmerican and antiSemitic propaganda,2.5,3.4,3.0
794,The State Department and American officials in Cairo have issued diplomatically phrased protests of Ibrahims trial and sentence,2.9,3.0,3.0
795,This is entirely insufficient,2.5,3.2,3.3
796,What is needed is a message delivered personally by Bush and other top officials not only about the inexcusable treatment of Ibrahim but of the contemptuous approach to democratic values,2.5,3.3,2.9
797,In May that judge sentenced sentenced Chang to 18 months imprisonment for obstructing justice and making 53700 in illegal campaign contributions to Torricellis 1996 Senate campaign,2.78,3.0,3.0
798,The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday July 31,3.0,2.9,3.0
799,Responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for rebuilding Lower Manhattan Gov George Pataki has sent word that its time to go back to the drawing board,2.6,3.0,3.0
800,It is the right message sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far,2.43,3.14,3.0
801,The governor like Mayor Michael Bloomberg now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero and a 24hour community in Manhattans downtown,3.25,3.12,3.25
802,While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp,3.0,3.2,2.9
803,and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,3.0,2.88,3.0
804,New York can not afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed,2.6,3.5,3.4
805,Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately,3.0,3.0,3.0
806,Opening the process to other designers both here and internationally will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary,3.0,2.78,3.0
807,The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground in particular with the transportation network,3.0,3.12,3.12
808,At this point planners have focused on shortterm repair of PATH and subway lines with mediumrange proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown,3.2,3.0,3.2
809,But at the time of Changs sentencing the judge Alfred M Wolin also said the businessman had cooperated closely with federal investigators providing them with information that was material and credible,2.9,2.8,3.1
810,Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp,3.0,2.71,3.0
811,and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region,2.8,2.9,3.1
812,Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals,3.2,3.1,3.0
813,But it would be expensive and the governor the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at longrange ways to pay the bill,2.82,2.91,3.09
814,Patakis recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy,3.0,3.12,3.12
815,Now he needs to follow through with action to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this falls election,3.12,2.88,3.25
816,The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday July 31,3.0,2.88,2.88
817,A debate on how to make the 32yearold Clean Air Act a stronger and more efficient instrument is surely long overdue,3.0,3.0,3.12
818,But the Bush plan falls well short of the only other credible proposal on the table a bill sponsored by Sen James Jeffords Independent of Vermont,2.8,3.0,3.0
819,Like Jeffords the president calls for substantial reductions in three major pollutants the nitrogen oxides that produce smog sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain and mercury,2.8,3.3,3.0
820,That is a huge omission,2.5,3.0,2.8
821,Even for the pollutants he addresses Bushs timetable is too leisurely,3.0,2.64,3.09
822,He aims to reduce all three by 70 percent by 2018,3.1,2.9,3.2
823,The Jeffords proposal would make the same sizable reductions by 2008,2.9,2.8,3.2
824,Finally the Bush proposal would roll back key provisions of the existing Clean Air Act that Jeffords would keep,2.8,2.9,3.0
825,Bush argues that the regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for reaching Clear Skies goals chiefly a marketbased emissions trading scheme will be so effective that the need for many existing rules will disappear,3.3,3.1,3.1
826,The ethics committee has the power to punish lawmakers with sanctions ranging from public or private letters of admonition to censure or expulsion,2.88,3.25,3.25
827,This page has long embraced emissions trading as an essential tool for reducing pollution at manageable cost,3.1,3.1,3.1
828,But some regulations aimed at specific regional problems that nationwide trading alone is unable to address can not lightly be abandoned,2.75,3.0,3.12
829,Among these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility in the national parks and rules governing pollution that drifts eastward from Midwestern power plants,2.9,2.4,3.0
830,Indeed Bush has already made clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of these regulations a provision known as new source review that compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade older plants,3.11,3.0,3.44
831,The Bush bill as written is not the way to get there,2.5,2.8,3.1
832,In Torricellis case it acted without conducting a full investigation saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal authorities,2.9,2.7,2.9
833,A lawyer for Chang Bradley D Simon said Tuesday night that he was disappointed that the ethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given Torricelli and that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by Torricelli to thwart the federal investigation,2.6,3.1,2.8
834,This matter was far more serious than what the committee found,2.57,3.0,3.14
835,This matter was far more serious than what the committee found Simon said,2.75,3.25,2.88
836,According to two government officials involved in the inquiry the Ethics Committee received a vast amount of information from federal investigators some of it under a court order issued in March,2.9,2.9,3.1
837,The committees letter did not mention Changs reported gifts to Torricelli of an 8100 Rolex watch about a dozen Italianmade suits and a 3816 antique grandfather clock,2.89,3.0,3.0
838,Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance of impropriety,2.38,3.25,3.25
839,Your actions and failure to act led to violations of Senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance of impropriety the three Democrats and three Republicans on the committee said in a threepage letter to Torricelli,2.5,3.1,3.2
840,A government official involved in the inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either incomplete or the subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses,2.8,2.8,3.2
841,The committee confirmed Torricellis claims he had made partial repayments to Chang for two gifts a largescreen television and a stereo compactdisc player,3.2,2.8,3.1
842,But it said the senator had showed poor judgment by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts,2.8,2.8,2.9
843,A person familiar with Torricellis testimony to the committee said he had told its members that he repaid the wholesale cost of the appliances because Chang told him that was what he had paid,2.8,3.0,3.1
844,wholesale,3.0,3.0,3.0
845,The ethics panel also criticized Torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from Chang,2.7,2.8,3.2
846,The statues the existence of which had not been publicly known before were displayed in Torricellis Senate office,3.0,3.0,3.14
847,The senators belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances displayed poor judgment and violated Senate gift rules the panel found,2.6,3.2,3.2
848,According to a government official involved in the inquiry the information reviewed by the Ethics Committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the period in which Chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to Torricelli the senator spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank withdrawals and other known sources of income,2.62,3.0,3.0
849,A spokeswoman for Torricelli Debra DeShong said he had fully accounted for all the money he had spent,2.9,3.0,3.0
850,Senator Torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and any funds used for cash purposes she said,3.0,2.7,3.0
851,Even after the ethics committee admonished Torricelli on Tuesday night one of his most important political supporters Senate majority leader Tom Daschle DSD continued to defend him stating that the panel had found Chang a witness wholly without credibility,2.9,3.3,3.1
852,a witness wholly without credibility,2.67,2.89,3.11
853,Moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter Bill Pascoe Forresters campaign manager said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave to the panel,3.0,3.0,3.0

914,Moore is a professional filmmaker he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites and to accomplish that effect uses subtle interludes instead of longwinded introductions,3.0,3.0,3.0
915,Not surprisingly much of the criticism of Moores film is misguided or outright wrong often vastly more inaccurate than Moores work itself,2.8,3.0,3.1
916,This is a common technique but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking they believe critics who claim that he is distorting the interview,2.9,2.9,3.0
917,What he does is standard filmmaking practice,3.0,3.0,3.0
918,The same goes for the interview which follows,2.91,2.82,3.0
919,Moores critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of balance,2.8,3.1,3.3
920,The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so,3.0,3.0,3.0
921,They were right,3.4,3.0,3.2
922,You claim that there was no way to change location since you have to give advance notice of that to the members and there were upwards of 4000000 members,2.67,2.89,2.89
923,10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date had the NRA really wanted to,2.78,3.22,3.33
924,That does not change the fact that they did just that,2.8,2.8,2.9
925,This is what good documentary filmmaking is about,3.5,3.2,3.2
926,And here the critics again ignore important evidence,2.2,3.0,2.9
927,When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver the crowd boos loudly,2.5,3.2,2.8
928,Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayors letter only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request not mentioning at all the reasons you have given,2.5,3.25,2.75
929,This booing by the crowd not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there and they effectively said Fuck you,1.7,3.7,3.4
930,Fuck you,1.2,4.2,3.8
931,4 The Kayla Rolland case,3.0,2.88,3.12
932,The rally took place on October 17 the shooting on February 29,2.56,3.0,3.0
933,Again standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion,2.9,2.8,3.0
934,It is brilliantly if unethically done,2.78,3.0,3.11
935,As noted above the from my cold dead hands part is simply Moores way to introduce Heston,3.0,2.89,3.0
936,Did anyone but Moores critics view it as anything else,3.0,2.75,3.0
937,He certainly does not attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered and as noted above doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is,3.0,2.89,3.11
938,Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland you write There is no indication that Heston recognized Kayla Rollands case,2.9,3.1,2.9
939,Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview he certainly knew about the case at that point,3.0,3.1,3.1
940,Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase 48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead,2.7,3.1,3.0
941,This is one valid criticism but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be rather it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moores fast pace editing,3.0,2.8,3.0
942,His documentary is full of subtle humor jawdropping dialogue and dark contrasts,3.1,3.2,2.8
943,The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there as will become quite obvious but simply to highlight the first mention of the name Kayla Rolland in the text which is in this paragraph,3.1,2.9,3.2
944,Unfortunately because the zooming is rather fast it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence so as you correctly note some viewers got an incorrect impression,2.7,2.9,3.1
945,It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website,3.0,2.5,2.9
946,However the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons,2.7,3.2,3.3
947,before he came to Flint,3.0,2.86,3.0
948,In the excerpt from said interview we can see that it is from March,3.0,2.86,2.86
949,All in all it is an accurate portrayal of Americas gun and violence culture,2.89,2.89,3.22
950,If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers why would he say this and show the month the interview was published,2.88,3.12,3.0
951,b Why should Moore leave the words Clinton is on the Today Show visible in the text which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part,3.0,3.25,3.25
952,I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing,2.9,3.0,3.2
953,c Both the soccer mom interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact,2.8,2.9,3.1
954,The camera lingers on BushCheney posters and the protestor is quoted as saying that we wanted to let the NRA know that we havent forgotten about Kayla Rolland,2.4,2.8,3.2
955,You make the hysterical claim that the interview may be faked on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee but if Moore had faked it why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestors mouth which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kaylas death,2.36,3.18,3.18
956,It also raises questions about Americas foreign policy of recent decades questions which have been all but ignored by Moores critics,2.8,3.3,3.1
957,This makes no sense,2.37,3.25,3.0
958,Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nations youngest school shooting months after the fact but this sequence of Bowling is without doubt the most unfair to Heston,2.5,3.4,2.8
959,The claims of deliberate distortion dont hold up when viewing the whole scene though as Hanlons Razor states one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence,2.7,3.0,2.9
960,The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions which is unfortunate but Moores critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly,2.8,2.8,2.9
961,In any case at no point does Moore make a false statement in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is full of lies,3.0,3.14,3.14
962,Having created the desired impression Moore follows with his Heston interview,3.3,3.1,3.2
963,The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie,3.0,3.0,3.0
964,On your webpage you state that Moores resolution is questionable,3.0,2.89,2.89
965,Moores resolution is questionable,2.6,2.9,3.1
966,After all early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence because Canadians like and Japanese positively love those,3.0,3.2,3.2
967,These people do not feel the need to express sympathy or to think about ways to avoid such incidents but they feel the need to assert their rights and to look for quick simple answers as Busch states gun owners wanted to hang the child from the highest tree,2.18,3.64,2.91
968,This is all not mentioned by critics of Moores movie who claim to be objective,2.9,2.9,2.9
969,Moore answers a simple question how could the scene have been filmed with a simple answer two cameras,2.9,3.0,3.1
970,From this you construct an obscure conspiracy of reenactment For all we can tell Moore could have shouted Hey to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left,3.0,3.0,3.12
971,For all we can tell Moore could have shouted Hey to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left,3.11,3.22,3.11
972,Hey,3.12,3.63,3.0
973,Even if your reenactment theory is true and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion this itself is not unethical and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview,2.8,3.0,3.5
974,You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion,2.73,2.91,3.27
975,6Animated history of the US Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film,2.8,2.7,3.2
976,But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely That the strategy to promote gun rights for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish,2.5,2.9,3.0
977,Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people,2.83,2.83,2.83
978,I highly doubt it,2.73,3.0,3.18
979,But if they didnt one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK,2.6,3.1,3.4
980,This is the key message of this part of the animation which is again being ignored by its critics,2.37,2.87,2.88
981,If violent movies and violent videogames can not cause violence then how can newscasts about violence do so,2.37,3.63,3.12
982,7 Buell shooting in Flint,2.6,3.1,3.0
983,You write Fact The little boy was the class thug already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil and had fought with Kayla the day before,2.5,3.0,3.3
984,Fact The little boy was the class thug already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil and had fought with Kayla the day before,2.57,3.29,3.43
985,This characterization of a sixyearold as a pencilstabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moores film warns against,2.2,3.5,3.3
986,It is the typical rightwing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset,3.0,3.3,3.4
987,The kid was a little bastard and the parents were involved in drugs case closed,2.3,3.3,3.1
988,But why do people deal with drugs,2.88,3.13,3.37
989,Because its so much fun to do so,3.5,3.2,3.0
990,It is equally well known that the socalled war on drugs begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population both in relative and absolute numbers,2.5,3.3,3.0
991,But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves but poverty and the war on drugs,2.6,2.9,2.9
992,This is a faulty generalization,2.44,2.89,3.11
993,Had the boys mother not been shipped to a welfare to work program she might at least have had some time to spend with her son,2.2,3.2,3.1
994,If as Moore implies although never states as fact video games and violent movies are relatively harmless it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless,2.8,3.0,3.2
995,Once again your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moores and Buschs assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes,2.4,3.3,2.7
996,Thats because while there is a socalled war on drugs there is no war on poverty,2.5,3.1,2.8
997,Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCRowners who are just too lazy to work,2.5,3.25,3.0
998,In reality what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen to the detriment of families,2.6,2.9,2.8
999,It is notable that the Wall Street Journals reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours It called Moores claim preposterous,3.0,2.9,2.9
1000,probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscarwinning documentary,3.1,3.0,3.0
1001,How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens,2.37,3.12,2.88
1002,8 Taliban and American aid,3.0,2.8,2.8
1003,After the September 11 attacks it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour,2.57,3.29,3.0
1004,Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001,2.86,3.0,3.29
1005,Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation but because of the Talibans violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies,2.7,3.1,3.2
1006,Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage,3.0,3.0,3.0
1007,Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraqs Saddam Hussein,2.9,3.1,3.2
1008,There is a huge difference for example between playing a game like Quake and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now,2.3,3.4,3.2
1009,Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moores website about the film,3.0,2.8,3.1
1010,9 Gun homicides,2.2,3.3,3.2
1011,His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources and as you correctly point out he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries,2.6,3.0,3.1
1012,A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncitecom website,2.8,3.1,3.1
1013,The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned according to guncite are Japan 002 per 100000 1994EnglandWales 011 per 100000 1997Germany 022 per 100000 1994Australia 044 per 100000 1994United States 372 per 100000 1999,2.9,2.8,2.9
1014,Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make concluding that gun ownership leads to violence,2.63,2.88,3.12
1015,In fact Moore mentions several counterexamples and more such counterexamples can indeed be cited,3.0,3.0,3.1
1016,It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly,2.5,2.8,3.2
1017,It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John Mary Lott,2.9,2.9,3.0
1018,If these causes were addressed gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem but also unnecessary just like it is in Switzerland,2.9,3.0,3.2
1019,10 Canada ammunition purchase,3.0,3.0,3.0
1020,You write Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart,3.0,3.1,3.2
1021,look at what I a foreign citizen was able to do at a local Canadian WalMart,3.22,3.0,3.0
1022,He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised,3.0,3.2,3.0
1023,Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal,2.6,2.9,2.8
1024,Once again you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and faking a word which Canadian officials have never used for such a distortion Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics,2.5,3.2,3.0
1025,His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim,2.78,2.67,2.89
1026,If anything it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with having a more mixed ethnicity,3.0,2.9,3.1
1027,While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA he should not be their spokesman,2.9,2.8,2.9
1028,In this case Hanlons Razor can be applied to Heston he is probably not racist but incompetent,2.9,2.8,3.1
1029,If Heston makes himself look like a fool that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore,2.67,3.33,3.33
1030,Conclusion,3.0,2.9,3.1
1031,You write Bowling for Columbine is dishonest,2.7,3.1,3.0
1032,Bowling for Columbine is dishonest,2.1,2.9,2.8
1033,It is fraudulent,2.3,3.4,3.0
1034,To trash Heston it even uses the audiovideo editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewers mind to a wrong conclusion,2.6,2.9,3.0
1035,None of this is true,2.44,3.0,3.0
1036,What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture,3.2,3.0,3.1
1037,It is not a flawless diamond the 48 hours scene in particular suffers from bad editing the statistics are suboptimal and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves,2.6,3.0,3.1
1038,Other than towards the NRA the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions and comes up with some thoughtful answers,3.1,2.9,3.0
1039,Obviously media propaganda can incite people to kill,1.9,3.2,3.1
1040,Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film he would have used other material photos from Americas Emergency Rooms,3.0,3.2,3.1
1041,Certainly Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today and his film fully deserved its Oscar,3.5,3.2,3.4
1042,The shrill and remarkably unsuccessful Internet campaign to revoke his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the films accuracy,2.5,3.2,2.9
1043,It is not only the highest grossing nonmusic documentary of all time among the users of the largest Internet film database IMDB it is also the highest rated one,3.6,3.5,3.4
1044,According to the LA Times the documentary genre owes a huge debt to Michael Moore after Bowlings success films like Spellbound and Capturing the Friedmans were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely,3.25,3.0,3.12
1045,It is unlikely however that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact,2.25,2.87,2.88
1046,Moores hypothesis which apparently comes at least in part from the book Culture of Fear by Barry Glassner also advertised on Moores website is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia which itself can lead to violent acts,2.8,3.0,3.2
1047,Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award,2.67,3.0,2.89
1048,This is consistent with the kind of mediaincited violence described above and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence,2.78,3.22,3.33
1049,It is no surprise however that US and European media do not question their own propaganda of fear,2.75,3.25,3.12
1050,Moores second hypothesis is that Americas foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists,3.0,3.0,3.14
1051,Children who grow up in wartorn regions are known for having similar views war is perceived as a normal part of existence violence as a natural way to solve disputes,2.62,3.0,3.13
1052,Their chances are small however as their arguments rely on polemic exaggeration and misrepresentation in other words on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using,2.75,3.0,2.92
1053,In a weaker sense the same message is projected to American children who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how the enemies of freedom are punished,2.6,3.1,3.1
1054,Moores film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV,2.6,2.6,2.6
1055,Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show,2.4,3.3,3.1
1056,They squealed like little piggies too so youll have to make do with oink oink squeeeeeeeallll for their last words,2.9,3.1,3.2
1057,oink oink squeeeeeeeallll,3.5,3.63,3.12
1058,That goes for your grandson Mustafa too by the way,3.0,2.75,3.38
1059,Still think fucking with the US was a good idea Sammy,2.5,4.13,4.12
1060,Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed,2.1,3.1,2.7
1061,Americans cheer the killing of children yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations,2.29,3.0,3.28
1062,It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moores film seeks to address,2.91,3.0,2.82
1063,Inaccuracies,3.0,2.67,2.89
1064,Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moores movies,2.6,3.2,3.0
1065,It is true that Moores film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme,2.9,3.0,2.7
1066,Lets look at some specific criticisms,3.0,2.9,2.9
1067,1 The bank scene listed on your website on a separate page,3.0,2.89,3.0
1068,It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks,3.0,3.0,3.0
1069,Dear David Hardy,3.0,2.8,3.0
1070,It is not explained what normally is supposed to mean but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film,2.8,3.0,2.9
1071,It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary,3.25,3.38,2.88
1072,According to the same WSJ interview Typically youre looking at a week to 10 days waiting period,2.71,2.71,2.71
1073,Typically youre looking at a week to 10 days waiting period,2.7,3.0,2.8
1074,Moores detractors have sometimes extended those 710 days to several weeks contradicting the banks own estimate,3.0,3.0,3.1
1075,The bank does exactly what it advertises It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account,2.7,3.3,3.1
1076,The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation a bank handing out guns to its customers higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious,2.43,3.29,3.14
1077,2 The LockheedMartin interview,3.0,2.8,3.0
1078,A defense of Michael Moore and Bowling for Columbine,2.8,2.8,2.7
1079,So you dont think our kids say to themselves gee dad goes off to the factory every day he builds missiles,2.9,3.2,3.3
1080,These are weapons of mass destruction,2.37,3.37,3.25
1081,Whats the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School,2.7,3.2,3.0
1082,In a time of simpleminded patriotism loud clear and dissenting voices like Mr Moores are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced partially through well funded public relations campaigns partially through conservative grassroots propaganda,2.22,3.33,2.44
1083,McCollum understands it this way otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized,2.75,3.12,3.12
1084,Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible,3.0,3.0,3.1
1085,In response to one Moore detractor McCollum wrote Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the US we make no weapons at the Littletonarea facility Moore visited,3.1,2.8,3.2
1086,Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the US we make no weapons at the Littletonarea facility Moore visited,3.0,2.8,2.9
1087,Of course critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military and that the company is the nations largest military contractor,2.9,3.2,2.9
1088,As Moore correctly points out it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence children learn by imitating adults,2.8,3.2,3.4
1089,Yes Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant but he makes no incorrect statement,3.0,3.0,3.12
1090,3 Denver NRA meeting,3.0,3.0,3.0
1091,Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards,2.62,3.13,3.12
1092,It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes shown on national TV even here in Germany,3.14,2.86,3.14
1093,It tells viewers Aha this is the person we are talking about,3.3,3.1,3.2
1094,It is Moores way to say Viewers meet Charlton Heston gun nut extraordinaire,3.0,3.12,3.12
1095,If you do have something better to do though by all means do it,2.8,3.1,3.4
1096,Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night,2.5,3.0,2.8
1097,Granted grading papers is important but no fun makes for a boring life,2.6,2.8,3.0
1098,since when I was your age I had fun playing with my adorable son and caring for another baby,3.6,3.3,3.2
1099,You need to try to have a life outside your computer,3.0,2.9,3.4
1100,The one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of Watchmen,3.1,3.1,3.2
1101,Id read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity but not being used to reading comics hadnt registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this,3.1,3.1,3.1
1102,The post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place,3.2,3.1,3.1
1103,So thanks a lot for that one,3.2,3.4,3.0
1104,SEK I started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my selections so I think it would be easier for me because Im rubbish with html to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics posts like the one Magistra mentioned and many others after that,3.1,2.8,3.1
1105,Plus Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I II,3.0,3.0,3.1
1106,I also liked Teaching the Overdetermined Image,3.5,3.0,3.0
1107,Your takedown of Cashill and the whole AyerswroteDreams was excellent and the Cruelcrueldeath post you know what Im talking about right,3.4,3.4,3.2
1108,Also The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant today as ever,2.9,3.1,3.1
1109,Agree with the previous two comments,3.08,2.75,2.83
1110,What happened to your post that appeared in my RSS reader yesterday,3.0,3.0,3.0
1111,Would it be possible to arrange your posts into three parties and give your many readers the opportunity to vote for one of them by secret ballot,3.0,2.9,3.1
1112,I feel your British readers would appreciate that,3.4,3.2,3.2
1113,However when I started looking through my archives it occurred to me that my output this year defines me much more sharply than in years past,3.5,3.2,3.5
1114,I cant believe I wrote all that last year,3.1,3.4,3.1
1115,What do I mean,3.0,3.1,2.9
1116,Granted the likelihood that Im suffering from the identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high but I honestly thought Id written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so,2.91,2.73,2.63
1117,Because Ive been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a Best of Acephalous 2009 post,2.5,3.5,3.5
1118,I noted on Facebook that from a statistical perspective what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see on a daily basis something you’ve never seen before,3.6,3.6,3.4
1119,The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twentyfive years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing,3.1,3.2,3.2
1120,This realization is obviously not of worldhistorical importance merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory,3.0,3.0,3.0
1121,The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write about riding in an elevator with Grimace,2.9,3.0,3.1
1122,Joe Sambito,3.0,3.0,3.0
1123,Wow,4.3,4.3,3.1
1124,Id completely forgotten about him,2.9,3.0,3.4
1125,I sometimes wish I could forget that Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach,2.1,2.8,3.2
1126,Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an insidethepark slam,3.0,3.1,3.0
1127,I didnt remember that I remember that but now that I do I do,3.1,3.1,3.1
1128,Memory as Gertrude Stein would say is funny,3.4,3.1,3.0
1129,Apparently the drug use sexual excess and weird UCI experiences havent softened your brain yet,2.6,3.2,3.4
1130,Whats really bothersome though is when you only remember things from your distant past,2.6,2.8,2.9
1131,My grandpa was alert till the end but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to talk about was 70 years in the past,2.66,2.92,2.75
1132,The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of it,2.9,3.0,3.1
1133,A guess but perhaps your grandfathers life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs,3.0,2.9,3.3
1134,It’s a truism I know but it has the benefit of actually being true,3.09,2.63,3.37
1135,You know what makes this post great,3.1,3.1,2.9
1136,No stinking cricket,2.3,3.3,3.3
1137,Yeah I remember Sambito from the Astros when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3000 miles from most of their division rivals,3.0,3.0,3.1
1138,Solid pitcher for a while,3.1,3.1,3.2
1139,Apparently he is a players representative now,3.0,2.9,3.1
1140,Prosthetic memory,2.9,3.1,2.9
1141,I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor of nine,3.1,2.9,3.1
1142,In this case the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an insidethepark home run and initiate a triple play in the same game,3.4,3.3,3.0
1143,It is true that at the end of time the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing but horrendous to watch in person,3.1,3.3,3.2
1144,Plus they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes,2.9,3.2,2.8
1145,nota bene An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities,2.5,3.4,3.4
1146,John Emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an insidethepark grand slam which made me remember that I had seen an insidethepark grand slam at some time in the remote past,2.9,2.9,3.2
1147,I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an afternoon game at Shea Stadium and thanks to the miracle of the Internet I can definitively say that at approximately 430 pm on 9 June 1985 I watched Terry Pendleton hit an insidethepark grand slam off Joe Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily,3.5,3.5,3.1
1148,Diagram of the polarizationopponent unit described by Lambrinos et al 2000,3.0,2.7,3.0
1149,The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarizationsensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes,2.86,2.71,3.14
1150,The evector heading returned from the two polarizationsensitive photodiodes 1 2 follows a cos2function,3.0,3.0,3.0
1151,These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the nalkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun causing a different ratio of nalkanes to nalkenes and the presence of branched nalkanes in the hydrocarbon profile Wagner et al 2001 as cited in Gordon Greene 2003,3.0,3.0,3.12
1152,Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate Arnold et al 1996 as cited in Gordon Mehdiabadi 1999 receptors to detect food and receptors for three types of pheromones those released by successful foragers returning with food those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest and those marking piles of trash as midden,3.0,2.75,3.0
1153,For the purposes of this proposal I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone,3.0,2.9,3.0
1154,I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot hereafter referred to as Antie that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest switching between the foraging patrolling and midden work behaviors,3.0,3.2,3.1
1155,This technique described by Ishida et al 2001 has been shown to improve the chemical plumetracking abilities of robots,3.0,2.89,3.0
1156,The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the onboard PC,3.0,2.78,3.11
1157,Finally Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object,3.5,3.1,3.2
1158,These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson et al Patent 4492949 and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage,3.1,2.9,3.0
1159,These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects,3.0,2.89,3.11
1160,A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below,3.1,3.1,3.1
1161,Table of sensors and their relations to the ant,3.0,2.7,3.0
1162,The red harvester ant lives in hot dry deserts building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain,3.0,2.75,3.0
1163,The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds many of which do not grow in the desert Gordon 54 where only a few varieties of small shrubs small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow Gordon 51,3.1,2.8,3.3
1164,Introduction,3.0,2.9,3.0
1165,Motors,3.0,2.44,3.11
1166,Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants,3.1,2.9,3.0
1167,There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs,3.0,3.0,3.2
1168,Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles,3.0,3.1,3.0
1169,A third motor will lift and lower the grippers allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head,3.2,3.2,3.2
1170,Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs,3.0,3.0,3.0
1171,Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants,3.11,2.67,3.22
1172,Other insects and creatures including other species of ants are present in the desert but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals Gordon 711,3.0,2.67,3.0
1173,Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section,3.0,2.7,2.9
1174,Antie will have a hybrid software architecture a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors but many subbehaviors will operate on a schema basis,3.0,3.2,3.0
1175,Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible and where appropriate different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked,3.1,2.9,3.1
1176,Common Behaviors,3.0,3.1,3.0
1177,A few subbehaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior,3.0,2.88,3.0
1178,The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode and are compiled here for ease of reference,3.0,2.89,3.0
1179,Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive Gordon 11,3.0,3.12,3.0
1180,Background,3.0,2.6,2.9
1181,Because of this I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie and will not create a fighting behavior,3.0,2.8,2.8
1182,Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside innest navigation an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into object identification and gripping a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following and the identification of other ants,3.0,2.9,3.0
1183,Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years,3.1,3.0,3.0
1184,The Ant the Robot,3.0,2.8,3.0
1185,Ants of this species are of two types breeding ants queens and drones and sterile female workers,2.9,3.1,3.1
1186,These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis and when combined with the forward cruise function should cause the robot to move at an angle,3.0,3.0,3.12
1187,In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading and also how far from the nest it is at its current location,3.0,2.67,3.11
1188,Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance,3.0,2.89,3.22
1189,We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees positive or negative and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters,3.1,2.7,3.1
1190,Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season which occurs but once per year,3.0,3.0,3.0
1191,The first function might look something like this,3.0,3.0,3.0
1192,To exit Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight and to get deeper Antie will seek a lower temperature,3.0,2.75,2.88
1193,The code may look something like this,3.0,3.0,3.0
1194,The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories brood care nest maintenance patrolling and foraging,3.0,2.75,3.0
1195,This void function will be called nestEnter and will take in no inputs,3.0,2.6,3.2
1196,To avoid bumping into things including other ants Antie be provided with an escape function,3.0,2.64,3.0
1197,Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction,3.0,2.8,3.1
1198,Regardless this will be a very simple function,3.0,3.0,3.14
1199,I will include one example,3.0,3.0,3.29
1200,Little is known about brood care as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest,2.88,2.75,3.0
1201,Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds,3.09,2.91,3.0
1202,Before picking objects up however Antie will need to identify them,3.0,3.0,3.0
1203,This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated,3.1,3.0,3.3
1204,Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell,3.0,3.1,3.2
1205,The code may look something like this,3.0,2.4,3.0
1206,Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest midden work occurs close enough to the surface to be observable,3.11,3.11,3.22
1207,Once the object has been identified Antie may grip it and lift it,3.0,2.5,2.8
1208,A simple void function grip taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying,3.0,3.14,3.14
1209,A void function release will perform this same action in reverse,3.0,2.6,2.9
1210,Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on antennae stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past Webb 1998 regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones,3.0,2.8,3.0
1211,As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk,3.0,3.0,3.0
1212,The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a leftIP or rightIP,3.0,2.88,3.25
1213,Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book Vehicles Experiments in Synthetic Psychology as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell et al 2003 to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models,3.0,3.0,3.0
1214,Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine,3.0,2.8,3.2
1215,Patrolling and foraging too occur for the most part outside of the nest and have therefore been studied extensively ex Schafer et al 2006 Gordon et al 2002 Gordon 2002 Gordon 1987,3.0,2.88,2.75
1216,For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow findFood and findMidden,2.9,2.5,3.1
1217,All three are void and take no inputs,2.7,2.7,3.1
1218,The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants,3.1,2.9,2.9
1219,As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with nonnestmates Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest,3.0,2.86,3.0
1220,Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot Colony Infiltration and Task Switching,3.0,2.91,3.0
1221,The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this,3.0,2.6,2.9
1222,Using these basic common behaviors more complex behaviors may be coded,3.0,2.9,3.0
1223,Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony Gordon 1996,3.1,2.8,3.0
1224,Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age ex Ingram et al 2005 and partially as a function of interactions with other workers ex Schafer et al 2006 Gordon 2002 Greene Gordon 2007,3.1,2.8,2.9
1225,Younger ants work more inside the nest and older ants work more outside the nest,3.09,2.55,3.0
1226,As a result I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in,3.3,3.2,3.3
1227,Midden work which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside will occur first patrolling which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside will occur second and foraging will be the final behavior,3.1,3.1,3.1
1228,Finally I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors,3.0,2.88,3.5
1229,The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior,3.14,3.14,3.14
1230,It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest,2.9,3.1,2.9
1231,As previously stated a midden worker must identify midden grasp it and carry it to the surface depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden,2.9,2.7,3.1
1232,A program encoding this behavior might look like this,3.0,2.88,2.88
1233,These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler though there is some overlap particularly with navigational problems,2.88,3.12,3.12
1234,Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes and reentering the nest,3.14,2.86,3.0
1235,This behavior will be implemented in two parts with a taskswitching algorithm based on age,3.0,3.11,3.11
1236,Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy Moron et al 2007 and that taskswitching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages Ingram et al 2005,2.88,2.75,3.12
1237,Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories Gordon 5760,3.0,2.9,3.1
1238,In the case of midden work Antie must be able to identify garbage grasp it carry it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum or until stimulated to switch behaviors,3.0,3.2,3.1
1239,To control for this behavior Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones,3.1,2.7,3.2
1240,This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths Gordon 45,3.0,2.9,2.9
1241,The code may look something like this,3.0,3.0,3.14
1242,Patrolling may be divided into two distinct subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling,3.0,3.0,3.0
1243,Trail patrollers will go much further until food sources are found and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow,3.0,3.0,3.1
1244,An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit,3.0,3.0,3.0
1245,A general site of food is all that the patroller need find the foragers will dig through the sand for the food,3.1,3.0,3.2
1246,Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this note that part is on a schema basis,3.0,2.5,3.0
1247,The integers nestpatrolage and trailpatrolage will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks,2.9,2.8,3.0
1248,Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers who may then upon smelling the returning patroller be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest,3.0,3.0,3.0
1249,The final behavior foraging will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R,3.0,2.89,3.11
1250,Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume,3.0,2.7,3.1
1251,This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest,3.0,3.1,3.1
1252,This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them,3.0,2.62,2.88
1253,The code for this adapted from Russell’s paper might look like this,3.0,2.83,3.17
1254,Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path Gordon 47,3.0,3.14,3.29
1255,To address this a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon,3.0,2.86,3.0
1256,The code might look like this,3.0,2.8,3.1
1257,An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest wander around searching for food sources identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is,3.12,3.25,3.12
1258,Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior I will not address task switching to midden work,2.9,2.9,3.4
1259,Infiltrating insect societies however is much simpler,2.89,2.67,3.0
1260,This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow Gordon 3334 Holldobler et al 1990 as cited in Webb 1998,3.0,3.0,3.0
1261,Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate,3.0,2.8,3.3
1262,According to Schafer’s et al model of forager activation every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit a fraction modeled at 00035 of inactive foragers joins the queue,3.0,2.88,3.0
1263,For the purposes of modeling Antie I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent irreversible and partly a function of age with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers,2.88,2.75,3.0
1264,The code to model this taskswitching might look something like this,3.11,2.89,3.0
1265,Antie will be a fully autonomous situated and embodied agent infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their taskswitching thresholds but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary,3.2,3.3,3.2
1266,In addition to following these trails to the food foragers must also be able to identify food grasp it and carry it back to the nest,3.0,3.14,3.29
1267,Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance,3.0,2.78,3.0
1268,REFERENCES,3.0,2.9,3.0
1269,Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task walk navigate both within and outside of the nest and of course switch tasks at appropriate times,3.0,3.0,3.0

1276,Antie be a circular robot no more than 1cm in diameter the length of a red harvester ant with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization,3.1,2.8,3.2
1277,A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs,3.11,2.89,3.44
1278,These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted,3.11,2.67,2.89
1279,Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance,3.14,3.14,3.14
1280,For the purposes of this proposal I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day,3.0,2.7,3.4
1281,A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached,3.0,2.8,3.2
1282,In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible these sensors include a thermometer photoreceptors bump sensors and sonar a polarization compass and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae,3.09,2.73,3.0
1283,On its front grippers Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure,3.0,2.88,3.25
1284,The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function,3.0,2.75,3.13
1285,The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius,3.0,3.0,3.2
1286,Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius Gordon 9 and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable innest navigation,3.0,2.83,3.17
1287,Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes,3.0,2.73,3.09
1288,These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night Gordon 5,3.12,3.0,3.0
1289,No robot has yet been constructed however that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them,2.9,3.0,2.9
1290,The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects,3.1,3.1,3.1
1291,The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions,3.1,3.1,3.3
1292,The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and 45 degrees from the center front of Antie respectively that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern,3.1,3.1,3.1
1293,These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light and research has shown that many insects including ants do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer Labhart et al 2002,2.9,3.0,3.1
1294,This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning,3.0,2.75,3.25
1295,True the USA has not suffered a successful major attack since 911 but this does not mean that we are safer,2.6,3.3,2.8

1297,This website and everything on it is in the Public Domain so you may use it freely even without attribution,3.0,3.1,3.1

1303,It can not withstand clearheaded scrutiny,2.7,3.2,3.3
1304,The fact is Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism much less defeat it,2.0,3.0,2.8
1305,By trying to stamp out terrorism by killing terrorists Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us more dangerous not safer,2.1,3.4,2.8
1306,And proof that Bush has failed may come at any moment explosively with one big successful attack here in the USA,2.6,3.2,3.0

1308,WHAT IS TERRORISM,2.5,3.4,2.8
1309,TERRORISM is the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective,2.9,3.1,3.0
1310,We believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of God because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people,2.4,3.0,3.2
1311,Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001 and terrorism is a far greater threat to us now than it was then,2.5,3.2,2.9
1312,Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it,3.1,3.4,3.5
1313,Without motivation terrorism will quickly die down like a plant without water,2.9,3.0,3.1
1314,We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force because brute force radicalizes the moderates and they then join the terrorists,2.8,3.1,3.1
1315,Brute force has failed in Palestine and it is failing in Iraq,2.8,3.1,2.8
1316,We try to be evenhanded in opposing all terrorism although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel The United States Russia India the Philippines Australia and others whom they falsely believe to be waging war against Allah,2.8,3.3,3.5
1317,And the secondgreatest terrorist threat comes from several countries mainly Israel who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves claiming selfdefense as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims,2.6,3.1,3.0
1318,In all of these cases above if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end,2.7,3.1,3.1
1319,The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically as has the number of active terrorists,2.3,3.1,2.9
1320,The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous,2.7,3.1,3.2
1321,They need to be identified and attacked,2.2,3.5,3.8
1322,If the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts he is less likely to perform them,2.9,3.0,3.1

1327,If we eliminate the legitimate grievances we have eliminated much of the motivation,3.1,3.2,3.4
1328,Is this negotiating with terrorists or trying to appease the terrorists as some IsraeliNeoCons would try to say,2.7,3.2,3.2
1329,No,2.7,3.3,3.5

1336,By Rev Bill McGinnis Director LoveAllPeopleorg,3.18,2.73,3.0
1337,Now many more moderate Muslims have become radicalized worldwide willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their purposes,2.5,3.2,2.8
1338,And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia India Maylasia the Philippines Spain and elsewhere as well as Israel and its sole supporter the United States,2.36,3.18,2.82
1339,Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,2.7,3.1,2.4
1340,Wilson 173,3.0,2.71,3.29
1341,but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition,3.1,2.9,3.4
1342,The Exposition,3.0,2.88,3.12
1343,As mentioned the first theme the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8 contains two head motives the first is the tritonespanning ascent that appears in the first measure and the second is an iteration of the interval cell +5 2 +5 that appears in the second through third measures,3.0,2.71,2.86
1344,Bartók describes the form of the first movement as more or less regular sonata form,3.0,3.0,3.0
1345,While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation,3.0,2.64,3.0
1346,Rather this motive is a smallscale representation of the tonicdominant relationship of tritone partners specifically F and B that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement,3.0,2.9,3.1
1347,Rhythmically we have a dissonance between the melody which follows the written meter and the accompanying chords in the bassoons horns and lower strings,3.0,2.8,3.1
1348,Example 9 reproduces the chords and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern,3.0,2.88,3.0
1349,This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody with its own hiccups occurring in the written 28 measures,3.0,2.55,2.91
1350,While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion it is perfectly accurate the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement not unheard of in Mozart sonatas and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order,3.0,3.0,3.2
1351,We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in Fthis is made clear from the onset both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77,2.9,2.7,3.2
1352,While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 7694 these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F,3.0,2.9,3.3
1353,E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95134 although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131,3.0,3.0,3.0
1354,Measures 95130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭ where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass,3.0,3.2,3.1
1355,Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass C♯ D♭ is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme,3.14,2.86,3.0
1356,The trombone motive in measures 134141 shown in Example 12 is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development although its importance is downplayed here,3.0,2.67,3.11
1357,This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯C♯BE with the addition of some passing tones in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths,3.0,2.9,3.0
1358,While the strong VI motion from measures 9091 does carry a tonal implication of dominanttonic such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context,3.0,2.89,2.89
1359,The passage from measures 8589 is centered on E♭ and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function,3.0,2.7,3.0
1360,Rather we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middlegroundlevel wholetone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2,3.0,3.0,3.1
1361,In measures 9195 the bass descends FE♭D♭C which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant,3.0,2.7,3.1
1362,However as previously mentioned C acts as a fake dominant that in measures 149155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B the true dominant,3.0,2.86,3.14
1363,The descent in measures 9195 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger,3.1,2.9,2.9
1364,The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple which is in stark contrast to the first theme,3.14,2.86,3.14
1365,B dominates as tonal center from measures 155191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it,2.88,2.75,2.88
1366,The backwards recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates,3.0,2.86,3.0
1367,Measures 192197 are in E♭ with the bass notes in the harp and measures 198209 are in D♭,2.9,3.1,3.1
1368,A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195another instance of the wholetone being filled in by a fourth,3.0,2.38,3.0
1369,The return to B in measure 210 is also filledin in this way by F♯ in measures 208209,3.0,2.6,3.0
1370,Paul Wilson points out that in substituting for F within an analogous structure B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement,3.0,2.8,3.0
1371,in substituting for F within an analogous structure B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement,3.0,3.0,3.0
1372,In our terminology this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant,3.0,3.0,3.3
1373,The Development,3.18,2.73,3.0
1374,As mentioned the development is divided into three subsections,3.0,2.9,3.2
1375,In Example 2 the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal centernone of these pitches is involved in the structural wholetone descent,3.0,2.88,3.0
1376,As Paul Wilson states the development is for Bartók’s music developmental in a relatively conventional way the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified and tonalities other than those expected arise,3.18,3.09,3.18
1377,is for Bartók’s music developmental in a relatively conventional way,3.0,2.75,2.88
1378,For example the fifth string quartet,3.0,2.57,2.86
1379,The only slight abnormality though it is certainly not unheard of even in classicalperiod sonata movements is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development,3.0,2.9,2.9
1380,Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second headmotive of the firsttheme,3.0,3.0,3.0
1381,Also see Bartók’s comments on that Bartók 414,3.0,2.9,2.8
1382,there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm contour and interval content are changed,2.88,2.75,3.5
1383,Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used,3.0,3.0,3.0
1384,Furthermore this section being the middle section of the movement upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme,3.0,3.1,3.1
1385,The first section of the development measures 231271 begins with a big Dminor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section,2.86,3.0,3.29
1386,Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239 it returns to D minor in measure 248 which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D,3.0,3.0,3.0
1387,Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction,3.0,2.75,3.0
1388,The passage beginning at measure 248 shown in Example 13 can be considered to be the theme of this section and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme,3.0,3.0,3.0
1389,This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section,3.0,2.75,3.12
1390,This section is reproduced as Example 14,3.0,2.88,3.0
1391,The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development Example 15 which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯,2.8,2.8,3.0
1392,Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group we could conceive of C as a subdominant in this movement,3.0,2.82,3.0
1393,As the example shows the development section is divided into three subsections the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition,3.0,3.0,2.9
1394,As tempting as this interpretation may be this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminologythere is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms,2.7,3.3,3.2
1395,The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316318 by the strong VI chord progression Example 16,3.0,2.75,3.0
1396,As previously mentioned the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme,3.0,3.12,3.0
1397,The resultant set is the pentatonic set FB♭E♭A♭D♭ the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set,3.0,2.7,2.8
1398,The second instance of the fugato section not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18 is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C,3.0,2.44,3.22
1399,The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363,3.2,2.8,3.2
1400,The following section measures 363389 especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this sectiononly to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation,3.0,2.55,3.0
1401,Hence on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTGSTGFTG which makes the overall form with the exception of the Introduction symmetric,3.0,3.0,3.0
1402,The Recapitulation,3.1,3.1,3.1
1403,The recapitulation as we have seen presents the themes in reverse order,3.0,2.6,3.0
1404,The second theme is initially presented in A as part of the wholetone descent and proceeds directly to G where it is restated slightly modified,3.0,3.0,3.0
1405,It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D which constitutes another filling in of the wholestep by the intervening fourth,3.0,3.0,3.0
1406,The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area but it leads to D in measure 444 which constitutes a V chord still applied to G,3.0,2.87,3.12
1407,Rather than resolve this D back to G however Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467,3.1,3.1,3.3
1408,E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme measures 456487 which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the muchanticipated recapitulation of the first theme,3.38,3.25,3.12
1409,The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such however there are some important differences,3.0,3.0,3.22
1410,Firstly its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it the first chord in Example 9 is an Fminor triad and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the Fminor scale,3.1,2.6,3.0
1411,Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement although his interpretation is somewhat different,3.0,2.9,3.1
1412,In addition to the modeshift we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19 and also that the written meter no longer changes,3.1,2.8,3.1
1413,In other words the piece in becoming more regular is beginning to drive towards the finishbecause of the formal structure the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement,3.1,2.8,3.1
1414,Indeed this section has the feel of a Coda to itit is much shorter than any other major section or subsection and the tonic harmony is active throughout,3.1,2.9,2.9
1415,See Wilson 168170,3.0,2.8,3.0
1416,Bartók is one of the many earlytwentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality,3.12,3.25,3.12
1417,While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work,3.1,3.1,3.1
1418,Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal musictheir system however is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum,3.2,3.1,3.2
1419,But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results,3.1,3.0,3.0
1420,To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra,3.0,2.8,3.0
1421,By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions,3.1,2.7,3.3
1422,It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive powerperhaps now we can understand why,3.18,3.0,3.09
1423,References,3.0,2.89,3.0
1424,Bartók’s music although it is often difficult to call completely tonal never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure,2.88,2.88,2.88
1425,When we say in F we do not imply F major or minor for that matterthe majorminor tonal system in general does not apply to this piecebut rather that the pitchclass F is the tonal center of the movement and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement,3.0,2.9,3.1
1426,Using this interpretation we can map out the local tonics tonal centers used throughout the movement as shown in Example 2,3.0,2.5,3.1
1427,Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra I,3.0,2.57,3.28
1428,In this example the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece IntroductionExpositionDevelopment­Recapitulationso we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins,3.1,3.2,3.0
1429,This remains true even with one of his last compositions the Concerto for Orchestra written two years before his death in 1943,2.8,2.7,3.3
1430,See Bartók 414415,3.0,2.78,3.0
1431,In this particular movement Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant C for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and Bthis and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections,2.9,2.9,3.2
1432,The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper,3.0,2.6,3.2
1433,The Introduction,3.0,2.78,2.89
1434,As Paul Wilson points out the title Introduzione given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures,3.0,2.9,2.9
1435,The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement,3.0,2.9,2.9
1436,To begin with the opening motive in the celli and basses shown in Example 3 outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center,3.0,2.9,3.0
1437,Indeed this set can be seen more as a byproduct of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself,2.9,2.5,3.1
1438,Furthermore the following two instances of this opening motive shown in Examples 4 and 5 remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set,3.0,2.63,3.37
1439,Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯ and adds pitchclass E to the pentatonic set of Example 3 creating a sixnote set of stacked fourths,3.1,2.8,3.1
1440,Each note is either approached or left or both by a fourth and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯,3.0,2.9,2.9
1441,The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯ through F♯ these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭ E♭ and G♭,3.1,3.0,3.1
1442,As previously mentioned this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a wholetone descent from F to F,2.8,2.9,2.9
1443,So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a usually ascending perfect fourth,3.1,3.1,3.2
1444,We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths indeed the structural wholetone descent is often filled in with the intervening fourth,2.9,2.9,2.9
1445,This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group mm,3.0,3.0,3.1
1446,We will also examine to what degree a tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from commonpractice compositional techniques,3.0,2.86,2.86
1447,155233 and as we will see it occurs in other places though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2,3.0,2.8,3.0
1448,Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths the same sequence of intervals occurs two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second 5 +2 5 each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples,3.1,2.9,2.9
1449,This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition shown in measures 23 of Example 8,3.0,2.9,3.0
1450,So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement within the first 29 measures we can already see structural harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole,3.0,3.11,3.0
1451,The section from measures 3550 is centered on E upon the return of D♯ enharmonically respelled as E♭ in measure 58 we see that E acts as its upperneighbor,3.0,2.71,3.0
1452,This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 5157 however while there is no clear tonal center for this section G appears in the outer voices in measure 51 although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor,3.0,2.67,3.0
1453,The concluding motive of this section in the violins the bracketed sections of Example 6 as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff,3.0,2.9,2.9
1454,Example 7 are related to the first head motive of the first theme which is shown in the first measure of Example 8,3.0,2.7,2.9
1455,All three of these motives span a tritone which as mentioned is the dominant relationship in this movement,3.0,2.6,3.3
1456,Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize,3.12,3.0,3.38
1457,Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space,2.8,2.8,3.0
1458,The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them,3.12,3.38,3.37
1459,It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space,2.9,2.9,3.1
1460,In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this backgroundIn this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in closed spaces,3.0,2.78,3.22
1461,In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white while men dressed in black Wigley,3.0,2.6,2.8
1462,These distinctions proved a certain rational order only attained by those able to afford of it,2.75,3.0,2.75
1463,White walls white clothing they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors,3.0,2.62,3.12
1464,Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury and leisure,3.4,3.1,3.1
1465,White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black for black did in fact hide stains,3.1,2.9,2.9
1466,The same goes with white walls in their impeccability it proved to whoever that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint,3.0,3.11,3.11
1467,Both as well were signs of the modern age man had reached,3.22,3.22,3.22
1468,Pure white was de rigueur partly because of its exciting novelty partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature,3.09,2.82,3.0
1469,The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature,3.29,3.43,3.29
1470,The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar normal lower classes,2.9,2.9,2.9
1471,Ever since the dawn of man human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature,3.0,3.0,3.25
1472,Furthermore with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes,3.0,2.63,3.25
1473,Now anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them,3.5,3.5,3.5
1474,Seeing as color is something of the natural world age old and archaic washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world,3.1,2.9,3.1
1475,This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man,3.11,3.0,3.22
1476,Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white,3.0,3.0,3.17
1477,Photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more natural,3.2,3.1,3.0
1478,This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform a world in black and white,3.14,3.14,3.14
1479,This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images especially images in color to the emerging field of art which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive while it assigned to the twotoned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence,3.0,2.9,3.0
1480,Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate sounds organized beings like all animals and vegetables express themselves by cries or forms contour or carriage,3.09,3.37,3.27
1481,Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and technology,3.12,3.12,3.25
1482,This then translated down into the world of fashion as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing as well as art namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space,3.0,2.75,3.25
1483,Seeing as since the time of Aristotle form was valued over that of color the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form,3.09,2.91,3.18
1484,Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy,3.3,3.2,3.2
1485,In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers,3.0,3.12,3.12
1486,Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum,3.0,2.9,3.0
1487,Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations,2.5,2.8,2.9
1488,Kitsch changes according to style but remains always the same,3.0,2.75,3.12
1489,Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money not even their time,2.8,3.1,3.0
1490,With the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms,3.1,2.8,3.2
1491,Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art while this kitsch was simply pure imitation,2.9,2.6,3.1
1492,Inorganic nature has only the language of color,3.0,3.0,3.2
1493,Thus said this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious high art while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes,2.8,3.2,3.2
1494,Of course during the early stages of color film and photography the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images,3.1,3.1,3.1
1495,For the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form,3.1,2.9,3.1
1496,It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald color then is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature while drawing becomes the medium of expression more and more dominant the higher we rise in the scale of being,3.1,3.0,3.0
1497,That was what made up the essence of an image not the artificial or superficial filling in of form with color,3.09,2.82,3.09
1498,Color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image,2.9,2.9,3.1
1499,These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality,3.0,2.7,2.9
1500,Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition,3.0,3.0,3.1
1501,These non colors allow for the appreciation of color,3.2,2.9,3.0
1502,When something is black and white it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen,3.0,3.1,2.9
1503,Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them,2.8,2.9,2.7
1504,It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process,3.0,2.9,3.1
1505,Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years,2.71,2.86,3.43
1506,Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color but perhaps it is human instinct to want to surpass and rebel against generations before so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration,3.0,2.8,2.9
1507,Thus is the ebb and flow of life,3.0,2.8,2.5
1508,The world is made up of a myriad of colors color gives distinction to our life it gives flavor and meaning,3.14,2.71,3.29
1509,In the Far East reaching a state of colorlessness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being the state of Zen,3.0,2.8,2.9
1510,What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal,3.11,2.89,3.11
1511,This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan,3.0,2.6,3.1
1512,For them reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form,2.91,2.91,3.18
1513,This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing,3.4,2.6,3.2
1514,In the Elimination of color in the Far East Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color,3.0,3.0,3.1
1515,This artistic acestism ie the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white manifests its real aesthetic function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues,3.1,3.0,3.3
1516,What would our lives be without color,2.9,2.9,2.9
1517,For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as noncolors,3.0,3.0,3.12
1518,It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no longer present,3.1,3.2,3.2
1519,It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space,3.0,3.2,2.9
1520,Without color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space,3.18,3.09,3.27
1521,That is to say under the total absence of color there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that have been killed,2.89,2.78,2.89
1522,Black and white are the consummation of all colors into one,3.3,3.1,3.0
1523,Black is life it is the infinite possibility of expression and development Black here is not sheer black,3.0,2.9,3.2
1524,For in it’s negation of all colors all colors are positively affirmed,3.22,2.67,3.22
1525,It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing,3.1,3.1,3.0
1526,In Western society this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of generations past,2.88,3.0,3.0
1527,Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century,2.8,3.1,3.0
1528,Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life representing modernity,3.09,2.82,3.09
1529,color became a moral issue seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form,2.8,3.0,3.0
1530,color is associated with the Fall from Grace,2.71,2.71,3.0
1531,It is something which speaks to the senses not the mind it is external and therefore secondary to life,3.0,3.0,2.9
1532,It deals with the body emotions not the intellect,3.12,3.25,3.0
1533,It strays from reason in the way which it consumes and manipulates life,2.5,3.25,3.0
1534,We went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence,3.0,3.1,3.1
1535,White is seen as representing spirituality the heavens and light it is all which is modern it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color,3.2,2.5,2.9
1536,It is the control of nature and the body and represents the modern man,3.29,3.14,3.43
1537,WHITE is the spiritual color of our times the clearness which directs all out actions,3.3,2.8,3.2
1538,WHITE is the color of modern times the color which dissipates a whole era our era is perfection purity certitude,2.9,2.9,3.1
1539,Abolishing color means controlling color,2.7,2.6,2.9
1540,The white surface exposes color presents it for disciplining,3.12,3.12,3.25
1541,It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames,3.0,3.0,3.1
1542,But before that it keeps an eye on itself watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for the stain of color,3.0,3.1,3.1
1543,colorlessness is not natural and thus proves man’s superiority over this world,2.8,2.9,3.4
1544,On the other hand we need color in order to distinguish black and white,3.11,3.11,3.22
1545,Just as those from the Far East the purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes the white glitter even more,2.88,3.12,3.37
1546,White and black stand out because of color and color stand out because of white and black,3.0,2.55,2.91
1547,They are linked intrinsically together one can not go without the other,3.0,3.2,3.1
1548,White is the setting for color,3.0,2.5,3.0
1549,In a mosque for example the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a strategic use of color All these things are clothed in a majestic coat of whitewash,3.1,3.0,3.3
1550,The forms stand out clearly the impeccable construction displays all its boldness,3.1,2.9,3.0
1551,What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to high art,3.0,2.9,2.9
1552,At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration,3.2,3.0,3.0
1553,The sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it marks,3.0,2.82,3.09
1554,We need this opposition between color and noncolor’ to make distinction between the two otherwise neither would hold such significance,2.9,3.0,2.9
1555,Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White,3.1,2.6,3.0
1556,White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash it brings together and unites,3.1,2.7,3.0
1557,White expresses a certain incorporeality,2.6,2.9,2.9
1558,Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less depending on their color value,2.88,2.75,3.12
1559,Against white one can actually establish the intensity of clashing colors white determines the tone in the first place,3.0,3.0,3.0
1560,and how can the state legislature single out two counties first Napa now Sonoma for this treatment,2.62,3.38,3.12
1561,are they going to go through the wineproducing counties one by one,3.0,2.9,3.0
1562,JohnLopresti said,3.0,2.9,2.8
1563,vive la OIVV OIVWineLabellingStandardEN2006 re at Fredric Ks BTYH website there is a review discussing MacRostie pinot noir,2.89,2.89,3.0
1564,I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville highlands thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in the uplands,3.0,2.88,2.88
1565,Then at Steves site there is an interesting discussion of his current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast,3.0,3.0,3.0
1566,Its easy to get lost in nomenclatures when one is striving for new concepts,3.0,2.8,3.0
1567,Winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders in premium winegrape production,3.0,2.5,3.0
1568,The problem of course is that by placing the words Sonoma County on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in Russian River Valley Dry Creek Valley Sonoma Valley or any other AVA in Sonoma,2.8,2.8,3.1
1569,There are many reasons why the new labeling requirement makes sense from all these perspectives,3.18,2.64,3.18
1570,JohnLopresti said,3.0,3.0,3.0
1571,sorry I keep forgetting the Fermentation sites html protocol here is the OIVV label guideline link again,2.8,2.7,2.9
1572,OK so heres the real requirement Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada that is located entirely within yada yada shall bear the designation Sonoma County on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on containers of 187 milliliters or less,3.0,2.9,3.0
1573,If I recall correctly this is almost exactly the same as the requirement for the government warning type size,2.9,2.7,3.0
1574,So the answer seems pretty clear to me just add Sonoma County to the government warning,2.66,2.89,3.0
1575,Johnonwine said,3.0,2.88,3.12
1576,It has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making Napa Valley a place associated with great wines,3.2,2.9,3.2
1577,Such an association will not be made with Sonoma County winesever,2.75,3.0,3.38
1578,Tom I would suggest that all Napa wineries good and bad benefit from having Napa Valley on the label it is indeed a great example of marketing what you describe as promotional effort,3.1,3.0,3.0
1579,County consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle,2.6,3.0,2.9
1580,That the fact that their wines cost less on average and the wineries are friendlier less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the public,3.2,3.0,3.2
1581,Heck if folks knew all that maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with Sonoma County on the label,2.9,2.8,3.0
1582,You suggest that this is a bad law that Sonoma County will never be associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is,2.5,2.75,2.75
1583,There no evidence that grapes grown in Sonoma County have any single distinguishing feature derived from the fact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County Assemblywoman Evans concludes By improving consumer education on each bottle conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to represent Sonoma around the world,2.9,3.1,3.2
1584,I have confidence they will change retool improve live up to their responsibilities,3.7,3.3,3.3
1585,I worked selling and marketing Sonoma County wines I won awards for my marketing efforts,3.5,3.0,3.2
1586,The story is simple,3.11,2.44,2.89
1587,People are receptive to it,3.25,2.75,3.12
1588,Selling the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy,3.83,3.0,3.17
1589,Thats my take anyway I dont aim to be contrarian but I dont mind being the sole supporter of the law as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy,2.8,3.0,3.4
1590,Shes correct,3.2,3.3,3.2
1591,Beginning in 2014 Sonoma County will receive a tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labelswhether they think the words Sonoma County help or hurt their marketing efforts,2.9,2.5,3.1
1592,Frankly if I was making high end wine from the Sonoma Valley Sonoma Mountain or Sonoma Coast AVAs that depended in part on the quality recognition that comes wtih these AVAs Id be pissed that Im forced now to put a placename on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and in some cases demonstrably lowered its perceived quality,2.4,3.6,2.8
1593,This moment marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations to come,3.3,3.2,3.1
1594,Proponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a similar law that demands Napa Valley be placed on all wines that are made from grapes grown in that appellation rather than simply using a sub appellation,3.0,2.6,3.0
1595,But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands Napa Valley in addition to simply Rutherford be placed on these wines,2.82,3.18,2.82
1596,It has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making Napa Valley a place associated with great wines,3.1,3.0,3.1
1597,Pushed as an effort to promote Sonoma County wines and a consumer education effort the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts,2.8,3.1,3.1
1598,Why is it important for someone making Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or Sonoma Valley Zinfandel to help promote Sonoma County a designation that has no ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel,2.88,3.12,3.25
1599,This is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate and its very valuable real estate for the sake of promoting something that is of little use to private commercial interests,3.0,2.9,2.9
1600,Ask yourselfIf putting the words Sonoma County on ones wines was such a great thing why dont more vintners who make Dry Creek Valley Russian River Valley Alexander Valley or Sonoma Valley wines already put these words on their label,3.1,3.1,3.4
1601,They legally couldif they wanted to,3.0,2.83,3.33
1602,The new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent of the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain over the labels of hundreds of vintners,2.5,3.3,2.9

1607,You found a way to tie this in nicely,3.6,3.4,3.3
1608,This is a case of overreaching government regulation costing business unnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations,2.8,3.0,3.1
1609,Its just unnecessary,2.5,3.12,3.25

1615,Exactly Tom,3.12,3.0,3.5
1616,And I am really pissed,1.8,4.0,4.0
1617,I still dont know whose interests are being served by this useless piece of crap legislation,2.2,3.4,3.1
1618,Yet the law does nothing to educate consumers,2.4,3.0,3.0
1619,Duh,2.6,2.8,3.2
1620,Ive got real skin in this game,3.27,3.18,3.27
1621,We are going to have to totally redesign our front label to make room for Sonoma County and so far every mockup is cluttered and decreases the impact of our brand,2.6,3.1,3.0
1622,Our best option looks like we will go to North Coast or California for our front label appellation and discuss the grape source vineyard name and meaningful AVA on the back label,3.1,2.6,3.1

1626,I estimate the value to be in six figures and we are a small winery,3.1,2.8,2.9
1627,For a larger winery with a betterestablished brand the value is much higher,3.2,3.1,3.2
1628,Eminent domain is exactly right this is nothing less than governmental taking,2.62,3.25,3.25
1629,The legislators who backed this should be ashamed,2.57,3.43,3.43
1630,Hardy Wallace said,3.0,2.6,3.0
1631,Thanks Tom This law is such BS,2.91,3.36,2.54
1632,JohnLopresti said,3.0,3.0,3.0
1633,I put in 1+ decades in trade coursework and several branches of the industry,3.1,2.8,3.0
1634,I support the new labeling requirement,3.33,3.0,3.44
1635,Together we have led the world into modern viticulture with the help of UC Davis and in some pretty good company from other regions,3.33,3.33,3.22
1636,I suppose the new law is all Sacramento hype,2.75,2.88,3.0
1637,But I think it will improve northcoast revenue and dignity,3.25,2.62,3.0
1638,When I was a kid in a county called Solano not too famous for wines or AVAs people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was where was Black Pt people always were confused how the somewhat neighboring counties had such similar names,2.9,3.0,2.9
1639,According to Noreen Evans an Assembly sponsor of the bill this new conjunctive labeling law requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area AVA located entirely within Sonoma County like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley must also include the word Sonoma County on the label starting in 2014,2.9,2.9,3.1
1640,Now after several decades in Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness for its viticulture and other industries,3.14,3.14,3.0
1641,The town of Sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from Solano County to Sonoma County,2.8,3.1,3.0
1642,The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village and for its viticultural traditions,3.4,3.0,3.2
1643,But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory and other AVAs within the county are starkly different from the characteristics of Sonoma valley and the town of Sonoma,3.0,2.88,3.25
1644,Vive la nouveau Sonoma County,3.2,2.9,3.1
1645,Nick Perdiew said in to JohnLopresti,3.1,3.1,3.1
1646,What do you make of the fact that vintners already are free to put Sonoma County on any label they want,2.7,3.5,2.9
1647,If it were effective wouldnt you already see it virtually everywhere,3.0,3.0,3.12
1648,I admit I dont see the reasoning of your argument here,2.88,3.0,3.12
1649,The issue of the costs to vintners is nontrivial too as you can see above,3.0,2.8,3.0
1650,Tom I wonder what the response would be in Napa and Sonoma if the vintners in Fresno convinced the state government to require California be put on all labels of wine made within California,3.1,2.6,3.0
1651,JohnLopresti said,3.0,2.7,3.0

1685,Wholesalers compete against each other perhaps you forgot,2.8,3.0,3.0
1686,They do not operate monopolies,3.0,2.9,3.1
1687,In Oregon for instance there are about 60 wholesalers competing for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side hardly the ideal monopoly situation,2.8,2.6,3.1
1688,In most cases where state laws allow shipping you can get a bottle of wine shipped from the winery of your choice,3.0,2.8,3.0
1689,A very important point to remember While large commercial wineries Factory wine producers may have the ability to market their own wine smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not have the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many cases let alone having their own transportation infrastructure,3.0,2.88,3.25

1701,Today’s system balances competition with public safety to ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative effects of an unregulated marketplace,3.1,2.9,3.1
1702,Is there really any competition when the statebased regulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of alcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market meaning that without use of a wholesaler a producer can not enter a states market,2.75,3.25,3.12
1703,It also means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink not consumers,2.5,3.2,3.0
1704,Unfortunately the effective statebased regulatory system in the US is under attack,2.25,3.37,2.75
1705,Over the past 10 yearsmore than 25 states have faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate alcohol and their ability to maintain a licensed system of alcohol controls,2.8,3.0,2.8
1706,The only challenges to the statebased alcohol regulatory system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for protectionist reasons,2.78,3.11,3.11
1707,Even in the wake of successful suits that challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust system of alcohol controls,2.9,2.9,3.2
1708,ON THE LEARN MORE PAGE httpwwwhr5034orglearnmore Litigation against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol regulators state attorneys general public health advocates and many others,2.91,2.82,3.0

1710,Litigation against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol regulators state attorneys general public health advocates and many others,2.8,3.2,3.1
1711,This bill currently in Congress would give wholesaler lobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine lead to the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol kill jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine beer and spirits punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the consumers that wholesalers wont and override the critical Constitutional principle of a single American economic union,2.6,3.2,3.0
1712,When the economic interests of producers retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the state than any other industry in america you might expect them to fight back,2.5,3.4,3.3
1713,As for those that have concern lets recall that its only a tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators that there is no formal support from state attorneys general only a mere handful of public health advocates a selection of recipients of campaign contributions from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support HR 5034,3.0,2.8,2.9
1714,concern,2.5,3.0,3.25
1715,According to a recent national poll conducted by the Center for Alcohol Policy 79 of respondents support the right of individual states to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of alcohol and 87 agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol regulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens not by judges,3.0,2.9,3.0
1716,HR 5034 The Lies The Facts The Fictions,2.9,3.0,3.1

1724,HR 5034 gives states the ability to pass laws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against outofstate wine shippers,3.0,2.75,3.25
1725,And we know such laws would be introduced into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws have been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years,2.88,2.75,3.25
1726,With so much at stake for Americas alcohol wholesalers and their protected monopoly status that props up unearned profits its no surprise they would swing for the fences with all their stategranted political power and attempt to pass HR 5034,3.0,2.88,2.88
1727,In fact HR 5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers receipt of a wine by instate shippers legal while making receipt of a wine by outofstate shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape home invasion or selling cocaine to children,3.0,2.7,3.1
1728,Fact Protection of a state’s power to regulate alcohol is not an industry food fight,3.0,2.8,2.7
1729,food fight,3.45,3.27,3.36
1730,Better to call the introduction of HR 5034 what it is an attack on the entire alcohol industry and consumers for the sake of protecting wholesaler profits,2.75,3.25,3.12
1731,Its no coincidence that brewers large and small wineries spirit producers and importers retailers wine education organizations wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose HR 5034,2.9,3.0,3.2

1736,It is the intent of this language to make clear the congressional support for the holding in Granholmprohibiting state laws that allow an instate winery to do something a similarly situated outofstate winery can not do,3.11,3.11,3.11
1737,It is the intent of this language to make clear the congressional support for the holding in Granholmprohibiting state laws that allow an instate winery to do something a similarly situated outofstate winery can not do Language that bars facial discrimination is included in the bill to codify this prohibition,3.1,2.9,2.9
1738,Language that bars facial discrimination is included in the bill to codify this prohibition I have great faith in the wholesalers ability to mislead,3.1,3.3,3.1

1741,All the state needs to do is offer the feeblest of justifications,2.6,2.9,3.0
1742,Read for yourself state or territorial regulations may not facially discriminate without justification against outofstate producers of alcoholic beverages in favor of instate producers,3.0,2.9,3.1
1743,state or territorial regulations may not facially discriminate without justification against outofstate producers of alcoholic beverages in favor of instate producers,3.0,2.71,3.0
1744,justifications,2.9,2.7,3.1
1745,structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system,3.0,2.8,2.9
1746,in other words discrimination is ok as long as the discrimination is written into the states alcohol beverage distribution laws,2.5,3.2,2.9
1747,Furthermore note that wine retailers are not even covered by this duplicitous language on justification,2.88,3.0,3.0
1748,all for the sake of protecting wholesaler profits by giving them unprecedented control and influence over the entire American alcohol industry,2.88,2.75,3.0
1749,justification,3.0,3.0,3.1
1750,Over half the states have been sued challenging their alcohol laws The lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense safeguards that require a facetoface transaction needed for ID checks to buy alcohol,2.67,2.33,3.22
1751,We know this because states have written laws that have gone unchallenged that require ID Checks to be made at the point of delivery of the wine,3.0,3.0,3.0
1752,Unelected judges should not set alcohol policy this responsibility rightly rests with individual state legislatures as guaranteed under the 21st Amendment to the US Constitution,3.0,3.11,3.44
1753,Judges never have set policy,2.9,2.7,3.1
1754,This is the big lie the wholesalers tell,2.88,3.25,2.88
1755,Judges merely tell the state when they have reached beyond what the 21st Amendment allows,3.0,2.75,3.0
1756,Surely the wholesalers dont mean to say that state alcohol laws should in no way be required to abide by the principles in the uS,2.5,2.87,3.12
1757,Constitution,3.1,2.9,3.0
1758,What next will the wholesalers argue the 21st amendment give the states the right to prohibit women from buying alcohol,2.56,3.22,3.44
1759,Will they argue that state laws banning AfricanAmericans from being distributors is legal under the 21st Amendment,2.8,3.2,2.9
1760,The wholesalers would have argued that the racist separate but equal philosophy had no business being litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the racist laws to overturn them with new laws,2.9,3.2,3.1
1761,We have courts precisely to adjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state laws,3.1,2.9,3.0
1762,It appears that wholesalers dont like the courts involved when the decision dont go their way,2.6,3.0,2.9
1763,The hypocrisy misleading notions and disinformation being featured at the wholesalers website supporting HR 5034 is staggering,2.0,3.25,2.62

1773,Despite its initial failings Siegel’s Flamingo survived him as did mob infiltration of casinos,3.0,2.86,3.0
1774,Freely flowing comps complimentary food drink and entertainment were the order of the day with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in,3.0,3.11,3.44
1775,While the mob was running the casinos promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert,3.1,3.1,3.2
1776,Many of them did,3.0,2.9,3.2
1777,Frank Sinatra Wayne Newton and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written,3.1,3.3,3.0
1778,For about 4000 years the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization,3.0,3.0,3.2
1779,The Rat Pack originally Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop all in town to film Ocean’s 11 landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay,3.0,3.0,3.0
1780,Other Hollywood stars came as well simply because Las Vegas was the place to be,3.0,2.71,3.0
1781,As a result more casinos emerged along the Strip,3.2,3.0,3.0
1782,The Thunderbird Desert Inn Sahara Sands and Riviera hotels were erected during this period luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of allnight partying exclusive entertainment and cheap accommodations,3.1,2.7,3.0
1783,There was no longer any question when you wanted some unbridled adult fun Las Vegas was the place to be,3.11,3.0,3.11
1784,New Legitimacy,3.11,2.67,3.0
1785,Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas corporate cash,2.89,3.11,3.0
1786,That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes,3.0,3.0,2.82
1787,Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium ad when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley,3.0,3.0,3.1
1788,A legitimate businessman Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos,3.2,3.1,3.1
1789,True to the myth the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse,2.83,3.0,3.33
1790,Thus began Hughes’ legendary threeyear 300million Las Vegas buying spree,3.0,3.0,3.1
1791,When it was over Hughes owned six casinos an airport and an airline along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains,3.0,2.9,3.1
1792,Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions both immediate and lasting,2.88,3.25,3.0
1793,Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes’ investments established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos where illegal skimming of profits was rampant,3.1,3.2,3.0
1794,Las Vegas with a Vision,3.22,3.0,3.33
1795,As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out a new Las Vegas emerged,3.3,3.3,3.1
1796,Far more progressive than the Archaics the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest,3.25,2.88,3.25
1797,The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US,3.0,3.12,3.25
1798,Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business,2.89,2.89,3.0
1799,The first to really do so was Steve Wynn a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget,3.0,3.0,3.1
1800,In the mid1980s Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort,3.2,2.9,3.2
1801,He bought several Strip properties the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort Mirage which became an instant success,3.29,3.29,3.14
1802,Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards,3.0,2.9,3.2
1803,They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables restaurants and a showroom,2.9,3.1,3.2
1804,Excalibur the MGM Grand the Luxor and New YorkNew York all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s offering themed environments and attractions for families,3.2,3.1,3.0
1805,As evidence of the everfaster nature of the city by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience,2.6,2.9,2.9
1806,This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society the ability to live in permanent shelters yearround without need to follow wildlife,3.1,2.9,3.0
1807,The latest approach is perhaps the best of the postmob era the comprehensive resort,3.0,3.1,3.0
1808,New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide including luxurious spas signature restaurants and exclusive boutiques,3.5,2.8,2.9
1809,Additionally a handful of resorts such as the SouthSeas themed Mandalay Bay the Mirage and the new Four Seasons are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market,3.3,3.1,3.2
1810,The crème de la crème of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn’s Bellagio,3.1,3.2,3.1
1811,Perhaps more important such highend accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era,3.22,3.33,3.11
1812,As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed,3.1,3.3,3.1
1813,With its new look and new aim the prospects are good despite the warnings,3.6,3.2,3.2
1814,Mysteriously the Anasazi vanished from the valley around ad 1150 leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes another huntergatherer tribe,3.0,2.5,2.88
1815,Inevitably some people will get burned in the process but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes,3.38,3.25,3.25
1816,And that more than anything is the one constant that characterizes the past present and future of Las Vegas,3.0,2.89,3.11
1817,Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi the Paiutes were destined to a seminomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived changing the nature of existence in the valley forever,3.0,3.0,3.14
1818,During this period the indigenous people lived in caves hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline,3.0,3.0,3.09
1819,From Mailmen to Mormons,3.0,2.8,3.1
1820,In the early nineteenth century America’s western territories were still largely unexplored,3.11,3.0,3.11
1821,For fifteen years Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail waystation,3.0,3.0,3.1
1822,In 1844 American explorer John C Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California,3.0,2.75,3.0
1823,A Brief History,3.0,2.57,3.0
1824,This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history,3.0,2.8,3.1
1825,In 1855 Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown,3.0,3.0,3.2
1826,Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years,3.0,2.8,3.0
1827,The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries,2.9,3.0,3.0
1828,The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith,2.7,3.4,2.8
1829,Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery,2.4,3.1,2.6
1830,Their supplies scarce their harvest meager and their spirit broken they abandoned the fort in 1858,2.2,3.1,2.4
1831,One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass,3.2,3.3,3.1
1832,Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off at least when it came to ranching and farming,3.0,2.78,3.11
1833,The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated,3.0,3.0,3.0
1834,Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres 260 hectares surrounding it dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch,3.1,3.1,3.2
1835,His determination had other results as well Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator,3.25,3.0,3.12
1836,Despite his ambition Gass’ success was shortlived,2.7,2.8,2.8
1837,In the late 1870s he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own,2.8,3.0,3.1
1838,Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development,3.0,2.6,3.0
1839,What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day,2.88,2.88,3.0

1842,At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West,3.1,2.9,3.1
1843,Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail this was about to change quickly,3.0,3.33,3.22
1844,When it did the Las Vegas Valley which at the time had a nonnative population of less than 30 would change as well,2.9,2.9,3.0
1845,Around 3000 bc native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture,3.18,3.18,3.09
1846,In 1903 officials of the San Pedro Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas eager to secure a rightofway for their Los AngelesSalt Lake connection,3.14,3.0,3.29
1847,Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair,3.12,3.12,3.12
1848,For all this the railroad needed land,3.0,2.7,2.8
1849,As mapped the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch,3.14,2.86,3.29
1850,Stewart sold 995 percent of her ranch to the railroad,3.2,2.9,3.2
1851,In early 1905 the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley,3.2,2.7,3.1
1852,On 15 May 1905 the railroad held a land sale a momentous step in Las Vegas history,3.5,3.1,3.1
1853,Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub,3.0,2.67,3.22
1854,By this time the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today with one exception the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas,3.0,3.1,3.0
1855,Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement,3.0,2.78,3.33
1856,With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property it was ready to become a real town,3.2,2.5,2.8
1857,Businesses sprang up overnight and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived,3.1,3.1,3.2
1858,One year after the auction the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents a portent of things to come for the next ninety years,3.12,3.12,3.12
1859,Dam Good Luck,3.5,3.0,3.0
1860,From the beginning Las Vegas was built to serve travelers,3.0,2.78,3.11
1861,Growth continued for ten years and by 1915 the town had telephones roundtheclock electricity and a growing population many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop,3.29,3.0,3.14
1862,The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23000 bc when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake,3.0,3.0,3.0
1863,But such heady progress would soon come to a halt,2.88,2.63,2.75
1864,Union Pacific then consolidated its operations eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility,2.89,3.0,3.0
1865,Additionally Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark County in 1909 a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling,3.0,3.0,3.17
1866,These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents,2.44,2.67,2.89
1867,But the southwest’s growing need for water combined with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity,3.22,3.22,3.33
1868,Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up both financially and literally,3.0,2.75,3.12
1869,These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River,3.0,2.67,3.11
1870,Not only did it create jobs but it also created Lake Mead the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada,3.5,3.33,3.5
1871,More Government Help,3.12,3.12,3.12
1872,The construction of Hoover Dam did not singlehandedly save Las Vegas however,2.88,2.75,3.0
1873,They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted,3.0,2.9,3.1
1874,It didn’t take long for the city to establish itself as a wildWest town with an anything goes attitude,2.9,3.2,3.1
1875,Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here available any hour of any day or night,3.0,3.2,3.1
1876,Strangely enough the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins and out of the 142 homosexual males studied only 14 or about 9 had homosexual brothers which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population Bailey Pillard,3.0,2.8,3.0
1877,More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a choice but rather a feeling that one is born with,3.2,2.8,2.9
1878,As one grows older they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons,3.1,3.5,3.1
1879,The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex,3.0,2.9,3.0
1880,Therefore neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a choice in the matter and asking a homosexual Why are you attracted to other members of your sex is likened to asking a heterosexual Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex,3.0,3.0,2.83
1881,Why are you attracted to other members of your sex,3.0,2.9,2.8
1882,Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex,3.0,3.0,3.0
1883,After all why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle,2.7,3.0,3.4
1884,Rather the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference whether to act on one’s sexual desires whether to tell others about such feelings or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions Marcus 9,3.1,2.8,3.1
1885,Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality nature vs nurture and why when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew and similar questions,3.0,3.0,3.0
1886,Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature rather than nurture Dobbens Woods,2.9,2.8,3.1
1887,Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual They’re not like My child’s going to be gay’,2.8,3.7,3.3
1888,My child’s going to be gay’,3.0,4.12,2.87
1889,Dobbens,3.1,3.0,3.1
1890,Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual,3.1,2.7,2.9
1891,When why he was a homosexual he explained It’s just the way you are you can’t explain it I was just born that way it’s like asking how the world was made no one really knows Dobbens,3.1,3.1,2.8
1892,It’s just the way you are you can’t explain it I was just born that way it’s like asking how the world was made no one really knows,3.1,3.1,3.2
1893,He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation it did affect his view of it,3.0,3.0,3.3
1894,When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality he commented They can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality but they don’t bring you up to be a homosexual I grew up in a place where homosexuality is accepted so that’s why I’m so open about being gay I accept myself Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual depends on how you’re brought up Dobbens,3.0,3.0,3.0
1895,They can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality but they don’t bring you up to be a homosexual I grew up in a place where homosexuality is accepted so that’s why I’m so open about being gay I accept myself Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual depends on how you’re brought up,3.0,2.9,3.1
1896,Woods generally agreed with Dobbens and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature rather than nurture when he commented that there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like homosexuality Woods,2.9,2.8,3.5
1897,boyhood,3.0,3.0,3.0
1898,In fact Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only real and lasting love and necessary for democracy,3.0,3.0,3.1
1899,When asked why he was gay he explained that it is simply something that I can’t help embedded in my head nothing made me do it Woods,3.0,3.2,3.0
1900,He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females only it was between males and other males,2.9,3.0,2.9
1901,He added that nothing happened to make me homosexual it’s always been there,3.0,3.0,3.14
1902,nothing happened to make me homosexual it’s always been there I’ve always been attracted to guys,3.12,3.12,3.25
1903,I’ve always been attracted to guys Woods,3.18,2.82,3.18
1904,What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females etc but never in a sexual sense,3.0,3.1,3.1
1905,Though he has always kind of fantasized about getting married to a female these feelings come from his romantic side which is different from the sexual side Woods,3.22,3.56,3.0
1906,always kind of fantasized about getting married to a female,3.3,3.4,3.1
1907,What exactly causes homosexuality,3.0,3.1,2.9
1908,He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust maybe he could work it out,3.1,3.0,2.9
1909,real and lasting love,4.12,3.5,3.38
1910,It’s like race It’s all something you can’t help it all comes to you It’s internal you can’t help it,2.7,3.1,2.3
1911,It’s all something you can’t help it all comes to you It’s internal you can’t help it Woods,2.9,3.0,2.7
1912,When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct,2.9,2.7,2.7
1913,He gave the example of birds which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next or catch their prey,3.0,2.75,3.0
1914,Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo,2.88,3.0,3.0
1915,Furthermore there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology Hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers and Zeus himself partook in such behavior,3.2,3.1,3.1
1916,fascinating,3.8,3.5,3.1
1917,His final thought I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction,3.0,3.0,3.22
1918,I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction It’s not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual it’s a spectrum,3.0,2.8,3.0
1919,It’s not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual it’s a spectrum Woods,3.1,2.9,3.0
1920,Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics,2.9,3.1,3.0
1921,For instance heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones as a female is required to reproduce children yet homosexuals are by definition not sexually attracted to females,3.0,2.8,2.8
1922,Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene it would have died out entirely by now or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences,3.1,3.1,3.0
1923,Since neither of these events have yet taken place it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene Fulkerson,3.0,2.5,2.88
1924,My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality,3.0,2.9,3.1
1925,No one knows for sure now although many think they do and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth,2.33,3.0,2.67
1926,Nonetheless I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes,3.0,3.0,3.0
1927,Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love Emond,3.25,3.13,3.12
1928,This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality this was not the case 100 of the time,2.88,3.0,3.62
1929,This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now but even as I write this new studies are being done,3.0,2.9,3.1
1930,Perhaps the truth is right around the corner,2.9,2.9,3.1

1939,But it was not until 1869 that the term homosexual was first used to describe a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex Marcus 1,3.0,3.1,3.0
1940,At this point in time Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia,2.9,2.7,3.1
1941,Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for same and the Latin word for sex whereas a heterosexual is a person whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex Marcus 1,3.0,3.0,3.1

1944,Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s upbringing,2.75,3.0,2.88
1945,Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee which was mostly homosexual in 1897,3.0,2.8,2.9
1946,He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin in 1919 which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later,2.9,3.2,3.0
1947,Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured,2.9,2.8,3.1
1948,The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most longlasting and controversial ones ever,2.9,3.1,3.3
1949,Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs with minor additions he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to cure homosexuals with the use of hormone injections,2.7,3.0,2.9
1950,This theory which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs starting in1864,2.83,3.0,3.0
1951,The first Vindex defended Urnings while the second Inclusa which followed shortly after described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire,3.0,2.75,3.0
1952,hermaphrodites of the mind,2.9,3.1,3.0
1953,Perhaps then it is a combination of some of these,3.1,2.9,2.9
1954,This he claimed made laws such as paragraph 175 a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior unfair and unreasonable,2.9,3.0,2.9
1955,A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior,2.9,3.1,3.1
1956,In an interview in 1903 he professed his beliefs I am of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people Homosexual persons are not sick,2.67,3.33,3.11
1957,I am of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people Homosexual persons are not sick They also do not belong in a court of law,2.87,3.5,3.13

2195,Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat,3.4,3.3,3.3
2196,Conversely the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake so the pleasure of the narrative to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory comes not from the death of the insubordinate disruptive force from watching the transgressions themselves,3.0,3.12,3.0
2197,In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end,2.89,2.78,3.11

2204,In these two stories the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda but the sexy aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover,3.0,3.4,3.1
2205,This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories,3.0,2.7,3.1
2206,However consciously or unconsciously these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine,2.89,3.11,3.0
2207,Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations,3.2,3.1,3.0

2218,Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from premodern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife since it is primarily associated with film characters particularly those of the film noir genre,3.1,3.1,3.1

2228,Two quintessential novellas The Lust of the White Serpant from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda a traditional Chinese story are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal,3.0,2.5,3.13
2229,In Eternal Prisoner Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams and the next morning he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business,3.1,3.2,2.9

2235,Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction,2.5,3.0,2.9
2236,In addition to distracting sexuality the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale,3.0,2.71,3.0
2237,In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective Christine Gledhill writes Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the femme fatale stereotype or not,3.0,2.67,2.78

2242,She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature,2.8,3.1,3.0
2243,This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored,2.8,3.0,3.1
2244,In both stories Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda,2.91,2.82,3.0
2245,Her husband becomes a monk and this further implicates Lady White Snake this time from a Buddhist perspective,3.0,2.9,3.0
2246,Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana,2.6,3.1,3.2

2249,Lust,3.4,3.8,3.2
2250,The implications of this are that a stronger more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery,2.9,3.2,3.2
2251,If they were Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character,3.12,3.12,3.25
2252,Instead both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her despite her depraved sexuality,3.0,2.8,2.8
2253,Certainly readers admire her patience and loyalty I searched everywhere and now that at last I’ve found you I’m very happy Ibid173 she gushes to him in Lust,3.7,3.2,3.2

2263,So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain completely forgetting the love he once had for her makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight,2.7,2.9,2.8
2264,These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued,3.11,2.67,3.22
2265,In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later a Buddhist monk Lai 53 would have been a satisfying ending,3.0,2.9,2.9

2342,After the Winter Olympics a French judge MarieReine Le Gougne was suspended by the International Skating Union for not reporting pressure she said was put on her by Didier Gailhaguet president of the French Skating Federation to vote for the Russian pairs team,2.75,2.88,3.0
2343,She later recanted and said that Canadian officials had pressured her,2.33,3.11,2.78
2344,The ISU later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for three years,2.7,2.8,2.9
2345,The federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a wider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounov or his unnamed coconspirators with Le Gougne,2.9,2.9,2.9
2346,A Russian accused of being in organized crime was arrested in Italy on Wednesday on an American complaint that he conspired to fix the pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at the recent Salt Lake Winter Olympics which were dominated by the sports judging scandals,2.6,2.9,3.0
2347,We have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with Russian federation officials,3.0,2.8,3.0
2348,We have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with Russian federation officials James B Comey the US attorney for the Southern District of New York said at a news conference,3.0,2.67,2.89
2349,He said that Tokhtakhounov reached out to a coconspirator somebody connected to the Russian Skating Federation who did the legwork for him,2.7,2.9,3.0
2350,reached out to a coconspirator somebody connected to the Russian Skating Federation who did the legwork for him,3.0,3.0,3.22
2351,Maxwell Miller Le Gougnes lawyer in Salt Lake City said no evidence of organized crime influence came up in her suspension hearings before the ISU I think this situation vindicates the argument that weve made all along he said,3.0,3.0,3.09
2352,I think this situation vindicates the argument that weve made all along,3.0,3.4,3.3
2353,Tokhtakhounov whose age was given by Comey as 53 or 62 is a major figure in international Eurasian organized crime Comey said,3.0,3.0,3.0
2354,major figure in international Eurasian organized crime,2.9,2.8,2.9
2355,Born in Tashkent Uzbekistan and now a Russian citizen he is known as Taivanchik or Little Taiwanese for his Central Asian ethnic background,3.0,2.9,3.0
2356,Comey said Tokhtakhounov had three residences in Italy Forte dei Marmi Rome and Milan,3.1,2.9,3.1
2357,The complaint against Tokhtakhounovs traces his contact with figure skating to 2000 when he proposed to Gailhaguet the creation of a professional hockey team in Paris that would provide revenue for the French Skating Federation,3.0,3.0,3.0
2358,Gailhaguet and Anissina are not referred to by name in an accompanying FBI agents affidavit but by their descriptions their identities are obvious,3.0,2.8,2.9
2359, ,3.0,2.8,3.0
2360,In return Gailhaguet told the FBI on Feb 23 as the Olympics were taking place Tokhtakhounov asked for Gailhaguets help in renewing his French visa which was about to expire,3.0,2.9,3.0
2361,But when Gailhaguet sought guidance from a French government official he was told that Tokhtakhounovs money is bad the affidavit said,2.62,3.0,3.25
2362,Tokhtakhounovs money is bad,2.14,3.14,3.14
2363,The federal complaint offers many details of the alleged conspiracy including excerpts from a transcript of the Italian wiretaps,2.89,3.11,2.89
2364,On Feb 5 the Italian wiretaps recorded Tokhtakhounovs request to someone identified as another Russian mobster to get the number of a Russian Skating Federation official,3.0,3.2,3.2
2365,is close to us he is a good guy he will do it,3.4,3.4,3.3
2366,Tokhtakhounovs action apparently came soon after he said he received a phone call from the mother of the female ice dancer presumably Anissina,3.3,3.2,3.2
2367,The Russian Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov who was arrested by the Italian authorities at his resort home in Forte dei Marmi appeared to have a singular motivation for rigging the competitions getting a visa to return to France where he once lived,2.9,2.9,3.0
2368,A week later after Berezhnaya and Sikharulidzes pairs victory the mobsters spoke again,3.0,3.1,2.9
2369,The second mobster expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the competition and suggested that Tokhtakhounov could call the ice dancers mother or the father and tell them everything will be OK,3.0,2.8,3.0
2370,mother or the father and tell them everything will be OK,3.0,3.0,3.0
2371,He appears to be referring to Anissina,3.1,3.0,3.1
2372,The second mobster added Our Sikharulidze fell the Canadians were 10 times better and in spite of that the French with their vote gave us first place,3.0,3.0,3.43
2373,Everything is going the way you need it,3.29,3.0,3.14
2374,They also discussed the coming judging in ice dancing in which the French and the Italian teams were the favorites,3.2,3.3,3.1
2375,The second mobster said the French pair had only three judges and of the two judges they needed to win the gold medal one is ours and the other our friends will give them,3.0,3.13,2.75
2376,only three judges,2.7,3.0,3.1
2377,Their concern for lining up more votes than they thought the Italian ice dancers had may stem from the Italian teams defeat of Anissina and Peizerat in the 2001 world championships,3.1,2.7,3.0
2378,But they seemed pleased that the Russian pairs victory was achieved with the French judges vote,3.2,2.9,3.0
2379,The French have nothing but the ice dancing the second mobster said,2.64,3.0,3.0
2380,Again Tokhtakhounov voiced his need to have his French visa extended and he said Anissina had tried to help him but Gailhaguet had thwarted her,2.9,3.2,2.9
2381,Also on Feb 12 a week before the ice dancing finals Tokhtakhounov told Anissinas mother in a telephone call that the Russian federation official had called me from America to assure that we are going to make Anissina an Olympic champion,3.7,3.5,3.4
2382,had called me from America,3.14,3.14,3.14
2383,we are going to make,3.0,3.0,3.0
2384,an Olympic champion,3.4,3.2,3.2
2385,He told her that the Russian skating federation official will help he has two or three judges,3.0,3.0,3.0
2386,will help he has two or three judges,3.1,3.1,3.3
2387,On or about March 7 in a conversation between Tokhtakhounov and Anissina she said she would have won the event without his assistance because the Russian judge did not vote for her and her partner,3.1,3.2,3.4
2388,She also apologized for not calling to thank him earlier but that Gailhaguet had forbidden her,2.9,2.9,2.8
2389,was involved with the results,3.0,3.0,3.0
2390,He assured her that it was nonsense but that Gailhaguet knows my name very well he tried to help me and later he made stuff up to scare you so you would not connect me to him even more,2.7,3.2,3.0
2391,The conversations seem to indicate a familiarity between Tokhtakhounov and Anissina,3.0,2.8,3.1
2392,Tass the official Russian news agency reported that Anissina attended a ceremony in 1999 at a Paris hotel honoring Tokhtakhounov for his philanthropy,3.25,3.0,3.0
2393,The federal prosecutor in Manhattan alleged in a criminal complaint that Tokhtakhounov had conceived and directed a scheme with a second man alleged to be in the Russian mob and a member of the Russian Skating Federation to secure a gold medal for the top Russian pairs skaters and for the top French ice dancers one of whom is a Russian,2.56,3.11,3.0

2400,What we call the labtofab time should be as close to zero as possible,3.0,2.9,2.9
2401,What we call the labtofab time should be as close to zero as possible Kelly said,3.0,2.9,3.2
2402,If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge wed have put the plant in Asia,2.75,3.12,3.75
2403,In a brief speech Samuel J Palmisano IBMs chief executive emphasized that it was important to make longterm investments despite the current slump in the technology business,3.1,2.8,3.1
2404,To play to win in technology you innovate and you lead,3.2,3.1,3.4
2405,In June IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings,3.0,3.43,3.72
2406,EAST FISHKILL NY IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 25 billion to build and equip the largest single capital investment the company has ever made,3.0,3.0,3.0
2407,But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips like those produced at IBMs facility in Burlington Vt is strong,3.2,2.7,3.0
2408,I need more capacity in that end of the market,3.11,2.89,3.0
2409,I need more capacity in that end of the market he said and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand,2.9,3.2,3.3
2410,If IBM has miscalculated the demand it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings,2.56,3.22,3.22
2411,But industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market,3.1,2.9,2.9
2412,The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand,3.1,3.1,3.1
2413,The diversity is the big difference with this plant,3.2,3.3,3.3
2414,The 140000squarefoot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology,3.6,3.5,3.3

2417,The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair,3.0,2.86,3.0
2418,Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is selfenclosed and essentially airtight the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants which looked like space suits,3.17,2.67,3.0
2419,The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper,3.11,3.22,3.11
2420,but the donuts are a lot more costly here,2.3,3.1,2.4
2421,Each wafer holding hundreds of chips is worth 6000 to 10000 apiece depending on what insulation circuitry and materials are used,3.2,3.0,3.1
2422,The factory which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump is a costly and risky move for IBM,2.86,3.29,2.86
2423,But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York,3.5,3.12,3.12
2424,IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips,3.0,3.0,2.88

2738,You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment,3.12,3.12,3.25
2739,That just unnerved me more,2.0,3.8,2.9
2740,My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school,3.25,3.12,3.12
2741,I noticed that there were some people on the street people the same color as the soiled buildings,2.75,3.0,3.0
2742,Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes,2.64,3.18,2.63
2743,he was already walking toward the squat brickwindowed building we were parked next to,3.0,3.1,3.2
2744,Glancing back at that gleaming glare I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car,2.75,3.25,2.5
2745,I hopped out ran after him and reached him just as he was knocking on the door,3.0,3.3,3.3
2746,Someone opened it a crack then ushered us in,2.8,3.1,3.2
2747,Sometimes wed get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges and wed rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up,3.2,3.4,3.3
2748,The ceiling was high and wooden and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall,3.2,2.9,3.1
2749,It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub,3.0,2.8,2.8
2750,Then I looked down and saw what had let us in,3.0,2.9,3.1
2751,What up,3.11,3.11,3.11
2752,The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap,2.75,3.0,3.0
2753,Nice my man,3.9,3.3,3.1
2754,Nice my man he said as they clasped hands,3.73,3.09,3.37
2755,Who’s the freak,2.22,3.33,3.33
2756,This is someone from Ivan’s family,3.11,2.89,3.11
2757,Did I ever tell you about them,3.0,2.83,3.17
2758,Yeah one time man but you were pretty fucked up,2.4,3.3,3.2
2759,What’s your problem kid,2.4,3.5,3.4
2760,The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach,2.8,2.9,3.3
2761,It pulled back around his fingertips which bore things that might have been nails or claws,2.62,3.38,2.88
2762,When he grinned I saw that his teeth were sharp and small like a hunting cat’s,2.86,3.0,2.71
2763,Nepthys quickly answered for me,3.0,2.57,2.57
2764,Girlfriend troubles,2.3,2.9,2.7
2765,Bummer,1.9,3.1,3.0
2766,So what’s the cat look like,3.3,3.0,3.3
2767,He turned to me,3.0,2.75,3.25
2768,Nepthys nodded It’s okay you can trust him,3.1,2.9,3.0
2769,It’s okay you can trust him,3.2,3.2,3.2
2770,That’s why we came here,3.2,3.1,3.2
2771,It was easier to talk than to question,2.9,2.9,2.8
2772,I I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel,2.9,3.3,2.8
2773,Boston is a strange place at night,2.7,2.9,2.8
2774,He was standing right in front of some blue lights so I couldn’t see him very well but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin,3.2,3.0,3.2
2775,He was slim almost drawn but he had a kind of luster to him I guess,3.1,3.0,2.9
2776,You wouldnt believe half of the shit Ive seen even when I was straight,2.7,3.4,3.2
2777,They nodded,3.0,2.8,3.0
2778,Oh totally,3.12,3.0,3.0
2779,Oh totally said the hunchback,2.9,2.9,3.1
2780,I get that all the time around here,3.1,3.0,3.1
2781,He was wearing a sort of jacket maybe blue velvet I couldn’t tell in the dark but it had ruffles at the throat things like that,3.0,2.88,2.88
2782,That’s why I couldn’t understand why noone else remembered him,2.8,3.1,3.0
2783,He had some rings too,3.0,2.62,3.0
2784,I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music,2.8,2.9,2.8
2785,What do you think,3.0,3.2,3.1
2786,asked the hunchback,3.0,2.55,3.0
2787,I’ve looked into it a little and I do think we might be dealing with one of them,2.6,3.0,3.0
2788,Have you seen anyone like that in your club,3.0,2.89,3.11
2789,Not that I can remember man,3.0,2.88,3.25
2790,I can send you to a guy who knows all about them though,3.0,2.6,3.1
2791,It was a Friday night,3.0,2.7,3.0
2792,If this cat’s for real I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know,3.1,3.2,3.0
2793,It won’t be long before nightfall,2.8,2.9,3.0
2794,Oh yeah man,3.57,2.86,3.0
2795,Rachel and I went out to dinner and when we finished she saw that there was a message on her cell phone,3.0,3.2,3.1
2796,Here let me write down how to find him,3.0,2.9,3.2
2797,Here you go man,3.0,2.7,3.1
2798,Good luck,4.09,3.54,3.0
2799,Thanks Dvorov,3.56,3.0,3.22
2800,I owe you one,3.6,3.1,2.5
2801,That last one was to me,2.8,2.9,2.8
2802,I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left,3.11,3.0,3.11
2803,He gave me a halfhearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing and whether I should be wearing body armor,2.9,3.0,3.0
2804,Back on the street I began to see things that I had never looked for until then,3.2,3.3,3.1
2805,Still in my initial shock I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked,2.6,3.2,3.1
2806,I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail,2.6,3.1,3.1
2807,I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light,2.67,3.22,2.78
2808,A corpulent batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle,2.75,3.0,2.75
2809,She checked it there in the restaurant,3.0,2.88,3.12
2810,Thirtyfive thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed,3.0,2.7,3.0
2811,I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards,2.78,2.78,3.0
2812,We and thousands like us have been living separately as long as there has been a human society said my driver,3.0,2.8,2.9
2813,Her head tilted into the phone as she listened her pleather purse on her lap shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance Tshirt,3.0,3.0,3.0
2814,I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills,2.9,2.9,3.4
2815,At this point we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional,2.8,3.2,2.9
2816,The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours,3.0,3.0,3.0
2817,Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner with the right protective spells,2.7,3.2,2.7
2818,He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us,2.88,2.63,2.75
2819,Okay Nathan,3.0,3.0,3.0
2820,We should get started right away,3.11,3.33,3.22
2821,There’s no time to waste,3.0,3.2,3.2
2822,He saw that I wasn’t moving,2.66,3.11,3.0
2823,Setting an arm on my shoulder he said Nathan what you see here might be frightening but those things you saw are people just like you,3.0,3.0,3.12
2824,They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms,3.1,3.1,3.0
2825,Thanks,3.43,3.29,3.14
2826,It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity,3.2,3.2,3.0
2827,Well she’s here and she needs your help,3.1,3.1,3.2
2828,But why are you even helping me,2.88,3.0,2.88
2829,Until thirty seconds ago I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of weirdness,3.2,3.4,3.0
2830,In this world one’s word is a promise,3.14,2.86,3.14
2831,Now can we get going,2.5,3.4,3.4
2832,Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name,2.75,3.12,3.12
2833,You’ve got a deal,3.57,3.43,3.29
2834,Let’s go,3.1,3.1,3.4
2835,As we headed down the sidewalk I said What is your name anyway,3.1,3.1,3.1
2836,That’s a question you learn not to ask here,2.8,3.1,2.9
2837,Holding Dvorov’s directions Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway,3.0,2.9,2.9
2838,I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were,2.4,3.3,2.4
2839,Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other he did not inspire confidence,2.2,3.1,2.7
2840,Just at this corner,3.0,2.71,3.0
2841,we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh er counterclockwise then face east,2.8,3.0,3.3
2842,East is that way,3.0,2.6,3.3
2843,He pointed at the wall to our right,3.0,3.14,3.14
2844,Don’t let the sun fool you,2.8,3.0,3.4
2845,Then I’m going to shed a little blood but don’t worry none of yours,3.0,3.43,3.43
2846,I blinked at him but he just kept walking until we reached the corner,2.9,2.9,2.9
2847,Okay you might feel silly but just turn three times to your left,3.0,3.2,3.2
2848,Try to keep in time with me,2.89,2.67,3.22
2849,We spun around three times and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust,2.6,3.1,2.8
2850,I don’t know it was going to be just us tonight,2.6,3.2,3.0
2851,The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground and I jumped back,2.6,3.3,2.8
2852,Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it opening the door,2.78,3.0,3.0
2853,Are you coming,3.0,3.0,3.0
2854,We slipped through the door and came out not inside the building but on a busy street in a completely different part of town,3.0,3.0,3.0
2855,The sky cupping over squat buildings was less yellow here and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East,3.0,2.87,3.13
2856,I’m not sure I’m up for a night out,2.5,2.9,2.6
2857,Nepthys took us immediately to the right where he led us to a cart filled with herbs,3.0,2.8,3.0
2858,Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon rosemary and scents I couldn’t place,3.1,2.9,2.9
2859,I was feeling calm and private that night,3.1,1.8,3.1
2860,Its face was small and wrinkled with pennysized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose,3.0,2.8,3.1
2861,Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs,3.2,3.0,3.2
2862,it asked,3.0,3.0,3.0
2863,There are no finer to spice a meal nor purer to mix a potion,3.11,2.78,3.11
2864,It seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal cupped hands offering a place for two not the burning open darkness of a rave,2.67,3.17,2.67
2865,We’re not here to browse,2.89,3.0,3.33
2866,We’re not here to browse Nepthys told him,2.67,2.78,3.33
2867,We’d like to see a man about some garlic,3.0,2.9,3.0
2868,The thing frowned,2.18,2.91,2.82
2869,We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart gentle sir,3.4,3.2,3.2
2870,If,2.9,2.8,2.6
2871,You know what I mean,3.14,3.0,3.14
2872,I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons,3.1,2.6,3.3
2873,It hissed thoughtfully,2.8,2.8,3.2
2874,True true,3.1,2.7,3.1
2875,Step behind the cart and enter through the door there using your left hand to open the door and your right,3.0,2.7,3.1
2876,to close it,2.9,2.9,3.0
2877,Thank you,3.9,3.1,3.2
2878,Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart,3.14,3.14,3.14
2879,The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack,3.0,3.6,3.0
2880,The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs,2.9,2.9,2.9
2881,We entered,3.0,2.88,3.0
2882,The room held a bed a bookcase and a desk with one chair,2.86,2.86,3.14
2883,Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls,3.0,3.0,2.9
2884,On the bed was a small ratty man,2.7,2.8,2.8
2885,I smelled matted hair and cedar chips,2.9,3.1,3.0
2886,We’re here for information about a vampire,3.1,3.2,3.2
2887,We’re here for information about a vampire said Nepthys,3.0,2.9,3.0
2888,Oh shit,1.9,4.3,2.9
2889,Sorry kid,2.4,3.0,2.8
2890,Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual,3.0,2.8,2.8
2891,Wait Nepthys you said nothing about vampires,2.8,3.4,3.0
2892,Frankly I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire,2.71,3.0,2.86
2893,Are look are they as bad as people in my world think they are,2.5,3.0,3.0
2894,I don’t know,2.56,2.78,2.67
2895,Only unsuccessfully right,2.44,2.89,2.89
2896,No those people don’t usually leave stories,2.87,2.88,2.75
2897,Oh thanks Nepthys for your confidenceinspiring tales of experience,3.7,3.4,3.4
2898,So they’re probably worse than we think okay that’s great,2.88,2.88,3.38
2899,Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel,2.9,3.0,3.0
2900,Let’s go together you know you’ll have fun once you get into it,3.56,3.44,3.33
2901,My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against,2.4,3.2,3.4
2902,Don’t forget she’s your girlfriend,3.0,3.1,3.2
2903,Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman,2.9,3.1,3.2
2904,I can hear your heartbeat from over here,3.37,3.63,3.12
2905,It came in through my mothers blood my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories bylichkas of ancestors with the second sight stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times,2.91,3.09,3.27
2906,I shut up and tried to breathe,2.29,3.0,2.43
2907,Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed who had not moved,3.0,2.8,3.0
2908,Please accept our apologies,2.4,2.5,2.6
2909,As you can see our situation is of personal importance to the young man,3.09,2.73,3.09
2910,Now may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire,2.55,3.55,2.55
2911,It would be a great help to us,3.44,3.33,2.89
2912,She bit the inside of her bottom lip looking at me like I was breaking her poor sweet heart,2.0,3.5,2.62
2913,My information is purely for the purposes of a collector,3.25,2.88,3.37
2914,I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm,2.88,3.12,3.5
2915,Sir we simply want to discover whether this individual is in fact a vampire,2.8,3.3,3.4
2916,If there is any boon that you would have us do in return we would be glad to do it,3.54,3.18,2.73
2917,He continued to lie in place still breathing heavily,2.7,3.3,3.1
2918,I tried to keep myself calm,2.8,3.1,2.9
2919,I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed,3.0,3.0,3.0
2920,My problem is that it was not made in this realm but by a human and only a human may handle it,2.6,3.2,2.8
2921,If you would fetch me this stone I would tell you what I can,3.0,2.67,3.33
2922,Of course we will fetch you the stone,3.12,3.12,3.0
2923,Of course we will fetch you the stone Nepthys assured him,3.0,2.9,3.1
2924,You have our thanks,3.7,3.2,3.1
2925,When we reached the street I expected some sort of temple or a row of antiquaries or at least a sleazy blackmarket relics merchant,2.8,3.3,3.0
2926,Instead it looked like we were in the redlight district women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys,2.91,3.09,3.0
2927,Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them,2.7,3.3,3.2
2928,Okay Rachel,3.22,3.11,3.22
2929,He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted like a saint under G d’s light and handcuffed,3.0,3.1,2.9
2930,Let’s go you’re probably right,3.0,3.1,2.9
2931,Inside the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions,3.1,2.9,3.0
2932,Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive,2.6,3.2,3.2
2933,A large woman similarly decorated quickly drifted up to us,3.1,3.2,3.1
2934,Good evening gentlemen,3.5,3.0,3.2
2935,May I invite you to have a cup of tea,3.11,3.11,2.89
2936,She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing not just pressing your face into someone else’s,3.7,3.6,3.0
2937,No thank you said Nepthys we regret that we can not take up your kind offer,2.5,2.9,3.0
2938,Are you the proprietor of this shop,3.0,3.1,3.0
2939,I am Madame Entera at your service,3.29,2.86,2.86
2940,She raised an eyebrow,2.9,3.0,3.0
2941,Are you,3.1,2.8,3.0
2942,Well we don’t get many customers asking about that item,2.78,2.89,3.33
2943,Please walk this way,3.0,3.1,3.1
2944,She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen,3.0,2.88,3.12
2945,The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd floppy hats on the other,3.25,2.75,3.25
2946,After this we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside,3.0,3.1,2.9
2947,Excuse me,2.9,2.7,2.9
2948,but may I ask what is kept in these rooms,3.0,3.1,3.1
2949,Why the merchandise of course,3.2,3.0,3.3
2950,Nepthys leaned close to my ear,3.14,3.0,3.14
2951,This is a slave shop,2.37,3.13,3.0
2952,This is a slave shop he explained quietly,2.12,3.12,2.5
2953,The woman paused before another door this one not barred but locked,3.0,3.0,3.0
2954,As she brought out the key she said We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items,3.0,2.88,3.0
2955,We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items,3.0,2.75,3.0
2956,We’ve had genies indentured sorcerers even golems and the occasional elf,3.22,3.0,3.0
2957,This is one of the stranger items though,3.0,3.0,3.0
2958,It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it,3.0,2.38,3.5
2959,If we only had a human on our staff we could have done so ages ago and sold it off but we have no such luck,2.57,3.0,2.86
2960,She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room,3.0,3.0,2.62
2961,Here it is,3.09,3.0,3.18
2962,Here it is she said,3.0,2.9,2.8
2963,With a flourish she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls,3.0,3.0,3.0
2964,Let’s not get fucked up tonight though okay Rache,2.83,3.17,3.33
2965,A marvel isn’t it,3.5,3.5,3.3
2966,she said,3.0,3.0,3.0
2967,That such a rock could hold so much magic it’s a wonder,3.67,3.5,3.17
2968,That it is,3.0,2.75,2.88
2969,That it is Nepthys assured her,3.0,3.0,3.0
2970,What would convince you to part with it,3.0,3.22,3.0
2971,No,2.5,2.88,3.25
2972,No,2.29,3.43,4.0
2973,she said seeing his expression that would make the stone rather useless,2.9,2.9,3.0
2974,appraising glance,3.3,2.9,3.3
2975,I have never felt so appraised in all my life,3.86,3.43,3.43
2976,He looks healthy,3.6,3.0,3.1
2977,He looks healthy she said how about a pint of his blood,3.0,3.4,3.2
2978,how about a pint of his blood,2.75,3.25,3.37
2979,Madame I have his health to consider,2.88,2.75,3.13
2980,Half a pint then and his hair,2.9,3.0,2.8
2981,Remember this is your quest,3.0,2.75,3.38
2982,I’m not giving my blood,2.2,3.4,3.6
2983,Sure babe,3.14,3.0,3.14
2984,As if I wanted it,2.6,3.4,3.4
2985,As if I wanted it interrupted the woman,2.44,3.44,3.67
2986,I think it’s a fair deal considering the return,3.2,3.1,3.1
2987,I think it’s a fair deal considering the return he told me but it’s up to you,3.3,2.9,3.3
2988,but it’s up to you,3.0,3.0,2.87
2989,I thought about it then nodded,3.09,3.09,3.09
2990,Marvelous cried the woman,4.0,3.67,3.44
2991,One halfpint of human blood willingly given and his fine head of hair for the stone,2.7,3.0,2.7
2992,She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping,3.0,3.0,2.9
2993,There was a wooden chair where she sat me down and asked me to wait,3.0,2.6,2.7
2994,Roll up your sleeves,3.0,3.4,3.4
2995,She opened the bowl and carefully gingerly brought out a fat dripping leech,3.1,3.3,3.3
2996,It must have been larger than my finger,3.0,2.9,2.9
2997,She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm,3.2,3.1,3.2
2998,The cold thing stretched and cast around with its suckermouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin,2.73,3.09,2.73
2999,I thought that I could feel a slight itching,2.5,3.1,2.9
3000,Let’s not waste any more time,2.63,2.87,3.5
3001,They take about a quarterpint each,2.9,2.8,3.1
3002,They’re quick too,3.14,3.14,2.86
3003,Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber,3.3,3.3,3.3
3004,She stood up and I followed her out to the street,3.1,3.0,3.0
3005,At least the barber hadn’t nicked me,3.3,2.8,2.7
3006,Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,2.9,3.2,3.0
3007,Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him,2.88,3.12,3.25
3008,Thank you for doing business at our house and I hope to see you again,3.9,3.4,3.1
3009,Come on,2.8,3.4,3.3
3010,Come on said Nepthys you could use a drink,3.18,2.64,3.09
3011,It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light,3.2,3.1,3.0
3012,you could use a drink,3.0,2.9,3.4
3013,We hit a bar on the next street over,3.12,3.0,3.12
3014,Vodka straight up,3.1,3.3,3.3
3015,Vodka straight up Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter and a Bloody Mary for my friend,3.0,3.0,3.4
3016,and a Bloody Mary for my friend,3.1,2.8,3.3
3017,Make it extra bloody,3.0,3.3,3.4
3018,That should help,3.4,3.0,3.0
3019,That should help he said,3.1,3.0,3.3
3020,You could run on empty with a little of that stuff,3.1,2.8,3.3
3021,He grinned at me,3.9,3.2,3.2
3022,Drink up kid,3.12,2.88,3.12
3023,Nepthys slapped me on the back,2.6,3.0,2.9
3024,Okay,2.88,3.12,3.0
3025,I mean what is this place really,2.7,3.1,2.8
3026,He thought about that,3.0,2.78,3.0
3027,I think that our world is a reflection of yours or yours is a more boring reflection of ours,2.62,2.75,2.88
3028,Without hearing the car horns I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes,3.1,3.3,3.2
3029,In America things are still weird after the European conquest,2.9,2.7,3.0
3030,The natives are still here but so is everyone else,2.88,3.0,3.0
3031,What do you mean,3.0,3.0,3.1
3032,Okay take elves,3.0,2.86,2.86
3033,He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot,3.1,3.0,3.3
3034,Not in America,2.62,2.88,3.38
3035,Here they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the gritty ambience’ you have them in your world too right,2.7,3.4,3.0
3036,There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf,3.75,2.75,3.12
3037,He has a real ear for it,2.91,2.73,3.27
3038,He downed the second shot,3.0,3.0,3.0
3039,I am glad to be out of the favortrading scene for half a minute,3.7,3.2,3.1
3040,It’s exhausting to talk to those people,2.78,3.44,2.78
3041,One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something,2.5,3.3,2.8
3042,So what else do you want to know Nathan,3.0,2.9,3.1
3043,I mean where do the dryads fit in a place like this,2.89,3.11,2.78
3044,If the tree isn’t around the dryad isn’t around,2.6,2.8,2.8
3045,It’s as simple as that,3.14,3.0,3.0
3046,That made me a little sad,1.89,2.89,2.78
3047,They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school,3.3,2.9,2.9
3048,Well what about you,3.0,3.14,3.0
3049,My parents came over from Russia just like your family,3.11,3.0,2.89
3050,My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate but we don’t toss those around in this place,2.62,3.12,2.88
3051,It was last February after the winter break that we moved in together,3.1,2.9,3.1
3052,They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary,3.0,3.0,3.0
3053,When the Russian government dammed the river my parents decided that instead of dying with the river they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected,2.9,3.4,3.1
3054,I was born here and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river,3.3,3.2,3.1
3055,He took another shot of vodka,2.91,2.82,3.0
3056,I mean we might have a lot of work ahead of us,3.0,3.2,2.9
3057,Are you kidding,2.4,3.3,3.1
3058,I can drink like a fish kid,3.2,3.1,3.2
3059,We should get going though,3.0,3.12,3.5
3060,Still woozy,2.62,2.75,3.12
3061,I nodded,3.0,2.71,2.86
3062,A little walking should get the stuff into your system,3.1,3.0,3.1
3063,As we left the bar I asked to see the rock,3.0,3.0,3.2
3064,Why,2.38,3.25,2.75
3065,Nepthys asked,3.0,2.29,2.71
3066,I’m just curious,3.11,3.11,2.89
3067,I want to see what a magic stone looks like,3.0,3.14,3.0
3068,Don’t worry I’ll be careful not to touch it,2.75,3.0,2.75
3069,He thought about it then handed me the pouch,3.0,3.0,3.0
3070,It looked like a normal river stone a gray oval with a white stripe through it,3.1,2.6,3.2
3071,I almost tripped over him and the stone went flying out of the pouch,2.8,3.3,2.9
3072,Nepthys tried to grab it but by reflex I caught it first,3.0,3.3,3.3
3073,Isn’t it an amazing night Rache,3.6,3.4,3.1
3074,Immediately I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid,2.1,3.3,2.9
3075,Nathan said Nepthys I think that you just did something very stupid,2.71,3.0,3.29
3076,I agree,3.56,3.44,3.33
3077,The stone was as warm as human flesh now and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat I don’t know,3.2,2.9,3.0
3078,Even the city feels alive when spring comes,3.8,3.8,3.5
3079,Then there was light a kind of rosy glow and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air,3.4,3.5,2.8
3080,I shouted hardly able to hear myself,2.6,3.4,3.3
3081,Nepthys was saying something that looked like I have no idea,3.0,3.11,3.0
3082,I have no idea,2.5,3.5,2.6
3083,but I couldn’t hear him,2.5,2.7,3.1
3084,The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in converging on the rosy glow around the stone and for a moment I was blind,2.7,3.2,2.7
3085,Taxi,3.09,3.45,3.36
3086,There was no sign of the stone,2.6,2.9,2.7
3087,I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop said Nepthys,2.9,2.8,3.0
3088,She waved down a car and pulled me in,3.09,3.18,2.73
3089,The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot,3.5,3.5,3.1
3090,Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles and soft white leather boots held her feet,3.1,3.2,3.1
3091,As soon as I touched her her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist,3.1,3.4,3.0
3092,In a few minutes we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church,3.0,3.0,3.12
3093,I couldn’t move,2.1,3.5,2.1
3094,Name me,3.1,3.0,3.6
3095,Name me she said,3.0,3.12,3.38
3096,What did you say’,3.0,3.2,3.0
3097,I was at a loss,2.0,2.83,2.34
3098,I’d never named anyone before,2.9,3.1,3.2
3099,I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name,3.3,3.1,3.2
3100,Amy,2.91,2.55,2.82
3101,You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer and you name her Amy’,3.11,3.22,3.11
3102,After she paid the driver she grabbed my arm laughing and we ran down the street,3.88,3.63,3.5
3103,So back to our garlicky friend,3.29,2.57,3.0
3104,I suppose so said Nepthys and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up,2.75,3.25,3.25
3105,and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up,2.3,3.4,3.2
3106,We walked back to the herb stand,3.12,2.88,3.12
3107,The vendor stared a little at Amy his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs,2.7,2.8,3.2
3108,When Nepthys opened the little man’s door he rolled over and grinned to see us but when Amy walked in he blanched,2.57,3.0,2.14
3109,What,3.1,3.8,3.0
3110,he screamed,2.22,3.78,3.0
3111,You idiots,2.22,3.44,3.44
3112,You woke it up,2.75,3.12,3.0
3113,But but sir,2.7,3.1,2.7
3114,But but sir I said are you sure she’s no help to you,3.0,3.1,3.1
3115,are you sure she’s no help to you,3.0,3.0,2.9
3116,Not if you named it already you ninny and I’m sure that you have,2.25,3.5,3.5
3117,I heard the pulse already,3.1,2.9,2.8
3118,Fools,2.25,3.75,3.5
3119,Get out of my sight now unless you know how to put it back,2.12,3.63,3.75
3120,Now leave before I call the rats on you,2.4,3.3,3.2
3121,You idiot,1.88,3.38,4.0
3122,I should say set yourself back since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for,3.0,3.0,3.33
3123,You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact,2.88,3.25,3.5
3124,Come on we’re heading out,3.0,3.1,3.4
3125,ome on we’re heading out,3.1,3.3,3.3
3126,He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs,3.4,3.0,3.1
3127,Walking outside I was shocked to see that it was already dark,2.9,3.3,3.0
3128,Night comes quickly here,2.9,2.9,2.8
3129,Night comes quickly here said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me,2.88,3.12,2.75
3130,Didn’t I warn you,2.44,3.33,3.33
3131,Okay,3.0,2.78,2.89
3132,First though we are getting you a hat,3.1,3.1,3.5
3133,You look ridiculous with a shaved head,2.4,3.6,3.2
3134,At a nearby stand he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston,3.14,3.14,3.0
3135,It was a black baseball cap that read Dead Can Dance in gold across the front,2.89,2.89,3.22
3136,Dead Can Dance,2.89,2.89,3.0
3137,Amy liked it I think,3.0,2.86,3.14
3138,She still hadn’t spoken since I named her so I wasn’t sure,3.11,3.0,3.11
3139,He took us to a squat long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal,3.0,3.0,3.0
3140,The black door opened as we came up to it and a pale man opened the door,3.0,3.12,2.75
3141,I only say he because he didn’t have a hint of femininity,2.82,3.0,3.27
3142,he,3.0,2.8,3.0
3143,His eyes were white,2.82,2.82,2.91
3144,From behind him I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s A Forest,3.29,3.28,3.0
3145,A Forest,3.0,2.9,2.9
3146,I’m here to see Isis,3.0,3.0,3.33
3147,Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her,3.0,3.11,3.11
3148,A moment later he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in,3.2,2.8,3.0
3149,Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind,2.9,3.0,3.0
3150,Amy gave my hand a squeeze,3.4,3.2,2.6
3151,Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade a vaulted ribbed intestine of a hallway whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic,3.0,3.1,3.1
3152,We kissed and slipped inside,3.9,3.8,3.3
3153,Then there was a door which opened as we approached,3.0,3.0,3.2
3154,Inside the space opened into a wide square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size,3.0,3.2,3.1
3155,The old vaulted church was stripped down there was no cloth on the altar just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer,2.3,3.1,2.9
3156,These were incontestably male,3.0,2.75,2.75
3157,Nepthys,3.0,3.5,3.38
3158,said the woman slithering up across the furs to sit up,3.14,3.14,2.86
3159,As she rose her robes fell open and I realized that except for what looked like a red silk kimono she was naked naked and stunning,3.55,3.64,3.09
3160,I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes,2.89,3.22,3.33
3161,It’s been years since I’ve seen you,3.64,3.55,3.09
3162,Please come and sit beside me and introduce your friends,3.29,3.29,3.43
3163,This man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world,2.9,3.1,3.1
3164,This man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world said Nepthys ushering us toward the woman in silk,3.0,2.88,3.12
3165,The girl is surprising,3.4,3.5,2.9
3166,The girl is surprising he concluded,3.4,3.3,3.1
3167,And I am Isis,2.7,3.1,3.3
3168,And I am Isis said the woman offering her hand to me,3.0,3.1,3.1
3169,I took it and dropping to one knee gave her fingers a small kiss,3.5,3.7,3.3
3170,It seemed appropriate,3.11,3.11,3.11
3171,It is an honor to meet you Lady Isis I said,3.9,3.4,3.1
3172,She laughed liquid alluring alarming,3.8,3.8,3.0
3173,He has lovely manners Nepthys despite his poor taste in hats,3.4,2.7,3.1
3174,You may leave out the Lady’ boy,3.0,2.9,3.4
3175,Through the dark I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix,2.9,2.9,2.8
3176,Now how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge,3.3,3.3,3.3
3177,I hope I can start by offering some wine,3.3,3.2,3.2
3178,Nepthys poured out wine for three of us,3.25,2.87,3.25
3179,May I have a little more of what you gave me before Nepthys,3.0,3.1,2.7
3180,I asked,3.1,2.8,3.3
3181,I still feel a little woozy,2.3,3.1,2.5
3182,The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth,3.37,3.13,3.12
3183,Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly,2.88,2.88,3.0
3184,Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved,3.0,3.0,3.14
3185,It was part of the price for this girl who was a rock at the time,3.0,2.88,3.0
3186,It was part of the price for this girl who was a rock at the time explained Nepthys,3.11,3.11,3.0
3187,I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,3.29,3.29,3.0
3188,I have a feeling that she was worth the trade I added,3.29,3.0,3.43
3189,Amy still holding my hand smiled,4.1,3.5,2.8
3190,She may be at that,3.0,2.9,3.0
3191,She may be at that said Isis gazing at her,3.0,2.83,3.5
3192,A confessional too beatenup to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside and where the pews had been taken out a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon,3.25,3.13,3.12
3193,She has good blood under her cheeks,3.22,2.89,3.11
3194,Amy didn’t blush and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying,2.86,3.14,3.14
3195,She would have been worth it,3.2,3.6,3.2
3196,She would have been worth it Nepthys interrupted if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact,2.7,3.1,3.1
3197,if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact,2.3,3.2,3.3
3198,He was going to give us valuable information for her,3.2,3.1,3.2
3199,Now I understand why you’re here,3.12,3.12,3.12
3200,Now I understand why you’re here said Isis,3.2,3.0,3.0
3201,So what do you need to know,3.0,3.0,3.37
3202,You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,2.9,3.2,2.9
3203,You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way said Nepthys apologetically,2.8,2.9,2.7
3204,I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire,2.7,3.2,3.0
3205,If I know him I can find him,3.0,3.29,3.57
3206,If not you’ll have to bring me something to work with,2.78,2.89,3.22
3207,Nepthys looked at me,3.12,2.62,3.12
3208,I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin his dark hair the way that light seemed to flow around him as best as I could,3.0,3.1,3.0
3209,Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full hanging breasts,3.1,3.5,2.9
3210,When I had told her all that I could remember she blinked her black lashes and said I remember him,3.1,3.2,3.2
3211,Nepthys could hardly believe her,2.71,3.14,2.71
3212,It is,3.0,2.9,2.9
3213,He should be,3.11,2.89,3.33
3214,I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot,2.6,3.4,3.1
3215,She sat up running her hands along her pale round thighs,3.2,3.1,3.2
3216,All right then,3.0,2.4,2.6
3217,Let me see if I can find him,3.0,2.86,3.0
3218,Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands,3.0,2.86,3.14
3219,A dark glow coalesced around her palms,2.9,3.0,2.9
3220,Amy leaned forward looking amazed,3.55,3.45,3.09
3221,The glow reflected on her pink face casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeatstrong cheeks,2.38,3.38,3.0
3222,Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis’ palms as her brow creased,2.4,3.2,3.0
3223,Her candy lips twisted into a frown,2.44,3.22,2.56
3224,The dark glow grew stronger and larger filling the air for about a foot around her hands,2.75,3.25,3.0
3225,In her palms the droplets of blood swelled into small pools,2.5,3.4,2.9
3226,The dark glow began to flicker and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry,2.8,3.0,3.0
3227,She didn’t shed a bead of sweat and I didn’t even see her draw a breath but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame,2.9,2.9,3.3
3228,Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake,2.8,3.2,2.9
3229,The blood in her palms still filling up began to ripple,2.88,3.25,2.63
3230,He glanced at me with honest concern probably the first honest moment he’d shown me Is she all right’,3.11,3.11,2.67
3231,Is she all right’,2.7,3.5,2.7
3232,She gasped and the dark glow went out taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam,2.8,3.2,2.9
3233,Isis collapsed on the fur strings cut,2.6,3.4,3.1
3234,She shook her head rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something,2.9,3.1,2.8
3235,She rolled onto her back her arms crossed tightly over her chest,2.9,3.3,3.1
3236,For the first time she looked vulnerable,2.7,2.9,2.7
3237,I found your vampire she said but he might know that someone’s looking for him,2.7,3.5,3.0
3238,He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden,2.6,2.9,3.0
3239,You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can,3.0,3.2,3.1
3240,She turned to me with tired sympathy,2.9,2.8,3.0
3241,I didn’t see a girl with him,2.8,2.9,3.3
3242,Hurry though and you might find him before he leaves,2.9,3.1,3.1
3243,A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants,3.14,3.14,3.71
3244,I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her,3.1,3.1,3.1
3245,He stood to go but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment,3.0,3.4,3.2
3246,There was a terrific echo each beat reverberating inside of the next and the old stainedglass windows rattled in their frames,2.7,3.1,2.9
3247,I turned back to the door,3.0,2.78,3.33
3248,Come on Amy I said he’ll be along soon,3.2,3.3,3.4
3249,When we got there another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood,2.89,2.78,2.89
3250,He offered it to Nepthys who opened the box on velvet lining a wooden hammer and two stakes,2.9,3.0,3.1
3251,Mountain ash,3.0,3.0,3.0
3252,I really hope we find your Rachel he said,3.25,3.12,3.12
3253,I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,3.4,2.9,3.3
3254,I know a quick way to Dvorov’s said Nepthys,3.0,2.8,3.1
3255,I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me,2.86,3.29,3.29
3256,The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart,3.0,3.2,3.0
3257,Yo my man Nep,3.8,3.8,3.0
3258,No but we got a tip that he might be in your club,3.0,2.9,3.4
3259,Have you seen him,3.0,3.1,3.1
3260,Here man,3.1,2.7,3.0
3261,I haven’t had a vampire here since you and Nepthys shot a wicked look at him,2.8,3.3,3.5
3262,Anyway long time man,2.9,3.0,3.0
3263,That’s odd,2.5,3.3,3.2
3264,On the dance floor people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air,3.5,3.4,3.2
3265,Do you mind if we check it out anyway,3.0,2.9,3.3
3266,I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere,3.0,3.1,3.0
3267,Dvorov glanced over his shoulder a little nervous,2.44,3.33,2.33
3268,We’ll be in and out in a minute,3.0,2.63,3.0
3269,Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor,3.1,3.2,3.0
3270,Dvorov asked us,3.0,2.88,3.0
3271,No he said that his research was purely academic not for hunters,3.0,3.0,3.0
3272,Bummer,2.11,3.22,2.78
3273,I guess I probably should’ve known though,2.25,2.75,2.5
3274,I mean he is kinda tight about that stuff,2.9,3.0,3.2
3275,He didn’t look very surprised,2.4,2.6,2.9
3276,Anyway this is the dance floor man,3.1,3.1,3.2
3277,Good luck,3.6,3.1,3.1
3278,Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking,3.1,3.2,3.5
3279,I danced with Rachel for a while but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes,2.9,3.2,2.9
3280,I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd,2.88,2.75,2.88
3281,Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me pressing me into the wall but I took a breath and kept moving,2.5,3.7,3.1
3282,My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat,2.38,2.87,2.87
3283,The music began to build and a strobe came on,3.25,3.25,3.38
3284,Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing for a second I was back with my family in Russia hiding from the cold,2.6,3.5,2.4
3285,Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me,3.17,2.83,3.33
3286,I gathered her under my arm,3.1,2.8,3.4
3287,Dvorov was somewhere behind me too negotiating delicately through his patrons,3.1,2.8,2.9
3288,It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf,2.63,3.5,2.88
3289,Its haunches twitched in time to the music,3.2,3.1,3.0
3290,As it started to rise a man with thick scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him,2.88,3.38,3.38
3291,She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd,3.0,2.88,2.88
3292,I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor,3.2,3.1,3.1
3293,Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this,3.0,3.3,2.8
3294,A cold thing with countless writhing tentacles fell against me thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose tripping me and clutching at my limbs,2.73,3.0,2.91
3295,A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing,3.0,3.25,3.0
3296,The creature blocking my vision moved back but I had seen all that I needed to see,3.12,3.12,3.25
3297,A bleeding eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me but I ducked around it and toward the bar,2.7,3.3,3.1
3298,When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song I glanced over at the bar,3.0,3.0,2.87
3299,I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before a mountain of wet veined flesh and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm,2.3,3.5,2.6
3300,He pulled my ear down to his mouth,2.8,3.5,2.7
3301,You seen enough man,2.7,3.3,3.3
3302,he shouted,2.4,3.8,3.2
3303,Yes,3.5,3.3,3.2
3304,Yes I called back I saw him,3.4,3.9,3.2
3305,I saw him,3.0,3.5,3.25
3306,He’s sitting right there at the bar,3.0,3.43,3.29
3307,Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing,2.6,2.9,2.6
3308,I don’t think he’s there,2.8,2.9,2.9
3309,No I saw him,2.7,4.2,3.5
3310,I have to hurry too,2.62,4.0,3.38
3311,Who knows how long he’ll stick around,3.0,3.25,3.0
3312,Listen man he’s not there,2.7,4.0,3.5
3313,I’m telling you it’s not even worth checking the bar,2.3,3.6,3.2
3314,Don’t do this kid,2.36,4.09,3.37
3315,It was just a little setup where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share mostly beer,3.1,2.9,3.0
3316,It’s a dumb idea,2.38,3.0,3.25
3317,Even if you did find this vampire cat he’d tear you apart,2.7,3.7,3.2
3318,Suddenly Amy screamed,2.0,3.71,2.43
3319,I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away,2.71,3.71,3.29
3320,His eyes were glowing red and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off,2.5,3.4,2.8
3321,The dancers near us tried to clear some space,2.9,2.8,3.0
3322,He shot back up hardly touching the ground and I kicked him back,2.75,3.5,3.0
3323,He jumped at my arm while I was still offbalance and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself,2.9,3.2,3.2
3324,Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand,2.8,3.4,2.9
3325,He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,3.1,3.1,3.1
3326,He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two he said by way of explanation,2.8,2.9,2.9
3327,You spotted our boy didn’t you,3.2,3.5,3.1
3328,I bet his hideout is nearby too,3.0,3.0,3.2
3329,Let’s hurry,3.1,3.4,3.3
3330,Rachel was standing with a plastic cup looking like she was having a conversation but I couldn’t see anyone else there,2.9,3.0,2.8
3331,He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip,3.0,2.88,3.0
3332,The crowd parted for us,3.2,2.9,3.2
3333,The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us,2.8,3.6,2.6
3334,In a blink of the strobe light he was on his feet and dashing from the room,3.2,3.3,3.1
3335,Come on,2.75,3.5,3.38
3336,shouted Nepthys,3.2,3.2,3.4
3337,We chased after him Amy keeping up valiantly behind us,2.8,3.4,3.1
3338,He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall and we chased up after him heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held,2.62,3.75,3.12
3339,Luckily the vampire turned off after three stories,3.1,3.2,3.2
3340,He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me,3.0,2.8,3.0
3341,I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us,2.75,3.37,3.25
3342,Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment,3.0,2.88,3.0
3343,Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room then made a turn out of sight,3.1,3.4,2.8
3344,When I came to the door at the end of the room it looked like it had been torn off its hinges,2.6,3.5,2.7
3345,I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him,2.44,3.44,3.33
3346,The vault rose into obscurity above me and a massive rose window stood ahead of me,3.0,3.2,3.1
3347,The panes looked dyed black and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter,2.82,2.73,3.0
3348,When I asked her if shed ever seen them before I was old enough to stop believing I mean she would always look sad and tell me No not since the family came to America has anything happened to us,2.71,2.71,3.0
3349,On the steps in front of the altar I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women,2.9,3.3,2.9
3350,He stood in front of a blue light so I couldn’t see him clearly but what I saw was memorable,3.2,3.4,3.1
3351,Then I heard Nepthys shout Nathan,2.9,3.7,3.4
3352,Nathan,3.27,4.0,3.18
3353,Behind you,2.8,4.1,3.4
3354,I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head leaping like a panther,2.8,3.3,3.0
3355,There was Nepthys on the other side of the pews holding the wooden box in his hand,3.22,2.78,3.11
3356,He tossed it to me and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again turning to face me,2.8,3.4,2.9
3357,I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes,3.22,3.22,3.33
3358,He leapt over the pews soaring like a grasshopper and drew a gleaming knife in midair,2.75,3.12,2.88
3359,I dodged but he tossed it and I held the box in front of my face,2.8,3.1,3.0
3360,The blade lodged in the wood its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin,2.62,3.5,2.63
3361,My arms shook from the force of his throw,2.4,3.4,2.5
3362,Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand,2.6,3.4,2.8
3363,His first move pulled out the dagger almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards,2.5,3.12,2.37
3364,He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet and his hair gleamed black against his white skin,3.4,3.2,3.1
3365,I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer ready to drive the ash spike into his heart,2.75,3.37,3.37
3366,Behind him I saw Nepthys running between the pews,3.0,2.9,3.2
3367,I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me,3.0,3.63,2.62
3368,I raised the stake he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine,2.3,3.8,2.3
3369,The stake went down there was a blur and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw,2.11,3.33,2.67
3370,Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant then all went numb,2.4,3.2,2.7
3371,My mind began to dissipate but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking,2.71,3.29,3.0
3372,This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking,2.6,3.1,3.2
3373,Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack,1.9,3.8,2.0
3374,I must have fallen to the floor then,2.3,3.0,2.4
3375,I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me and I heard steel crack then bone,2.38,3.25,2.62
3376,The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor setting off his striking face without illuminating its details and his wrists flashed white in the darkness,2.9,3.1,3.0
3377,I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me,2.75,3.0,3.0
3378,Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar,2.9,2.8,2.9
3379,I was content to let myself drift away and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek,2.7,3.3,3.1
3380,A girl’s voice soft and almost recognizable spoke Nathan,3.1,3.1,3.0
3381,Nathan,3.0,2.63,3.12
3382,I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected,3.2,2.9,3.0
3383,Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake,3.0,3.2,3.0
3384,I stood and turned toward the altar,3.0,3.0,3.1
3385,The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me,2.56,3.56,2.89
3386,I stepped up behind him and raised my hands which almost seemed to be glowing,3.3,3.4,3.3
3387,Then the stake came down into his back and one two three strikes with the hammer drove it in,2.3,3.5,2.7
3388,The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth,2.38,3.38,2.62
3389,Behind me Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug,3.0,2.71,3.0
3390,Rachel her clothes torn and her face drawn looked like she might cry when she saw me,2.33,4.0,2.89
3391,I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me,3.7,3.8,3.3
3392,My fuckin’ hero,3.5,3.9,3.2
3393,My fuckin’ hero she whispered,3.8,3.7,3.6
3394,The next time I saw them his mouth was moving,3.0,2.9,3.0
3395,She nodded and he took her arm,3.1,2.9,3.1
3396,I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong,2.4,3.5,2.8
3397,Saturday morning I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home,2.5,3.2,3.0
3398,I called Mitch and our other friends hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses but I had no luck,2.4,3.0,2.8
3399,A couple of them remembered seeing her leave but none of them had seen the thin man with her,3.0,3.0,3.0
3400,I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features even in that distorting light,2.78,2.78,3.11
3401,Nathan’s Bylichka,3.0,2.8,3.1
3402,I caught a taxi back to the church,3.0,2.88,3.25
3403,It was still a mess but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared,2.6,3.0,3.2
3404,The church was completely different now sunlight fell through the stained glass catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry healthy warmth into the edges of the room through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights,3.1,2.8,3.0
3405,Standing in the center of the church I took out my cell phone and called the police,2.8,3.2,3.1
3406,I need to file a missing persons report,2.3,2.8,3.0
3407,Rachel Frieze,2.82,2.91,3.18
3408,Last night walking on West 2nd street around maybe eleven or twelve o’clock,3.0,2.86,3.0
3409,But sir this is an unusual situation,2.7,3.0,3.0
3410,But if you ever should see a faerie tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly,3.1,3.2,3.3
3411,My girlfriend has disappeared I don’t even know where to start looking and I need help,1.57,4.0,2.14
3412,I understand,3.0,2.71,3.0
3413,The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight,2.7,3.0,2.7
3414,Walking out of the church a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise,2.9,3.1,2.8
3415,A cold front must have hit while I was inside,2.82,2.91,2.91
3416,Glancing down the street I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran,2.5,3.1,2.8
3417,I pulled my Tshirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go but I wasn’t ready for cold,2.9,3.1,3.0
3418,Walking didn’t build up much heat it just moved the air enough to chill me more,2.75,3.0,3.0
3419,After I’d walked about a block a car rolled up behind me,2.63,2.75,2.75
3420,Hey said a male voice do you need some help,3.0,3.3,3.2
3421,I turned around,3.0,2.9,3.0
3422,The man looked over forty and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street,2.5,3.1,2.7
3423,It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,2.91,3.09,3.09
3424,he said,3.0,2.75,3.12
3425,Would you like some help,3.2,2.9,3.4
3426,Ah I think I’m fine thanks,3.44,2.78,3.11
3427,Ah I think I’m fine thanks I told him and turned back to the sidewalk,3.38,3.12,3.0
3428,As I got older I shook the tales off with a nod and a Yes Nana,3.0,2.5,3.1
3429,Really I’d like to help,3.4,3.5,3.3
3430,Please hop in,3.2,2.8,3.1
3431,You don’t look dressed for this weather,2.7,2.9,3.2
3432,I glanced back over my shoulder,2.8,3.2,2.7
3433,No thanks sir,2.63,3.5,3.12
3434,I’m just fine,3.4,3.0,3.1
3435,Really don’t worry about me,2.8,2.9,2.9
3436,Nathan Spencer I offer you help,3.2,3.2,3.3
3437,I advise that you not refuse me a third time,2.1,3.3,3.7
3438,I stopped and looked back at him surprised,3.0,3.8,3.1
3439,He met my eyes coolly,2.9,2.9,3.0
3440,How do you know my name,2.8,3.3,2.9
3441,I know your family,3.0,2.9,2.9
3442,Get in,2.9,3.1,3.3
3443,We have a lot of work ahead of us and it’s best to start now,2.9,3.0,3.0
3444,Yes Nana,3.1,3.0,2.9
3445,I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat,3.0,2.5,3.0
3446,Before I had my belt on we were rolling forward,2.8,2.7,3.0
3447,Okay,3.09,2.64,3.0
3448,I’m in the car,3.0,3.1,3.3
3449,I got older and went to school then to college and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything,2.91,3.0,2.91
3450,In fact why didn’t you call me by name the first time,2.7,3.3,3.4
3451,And how did you recognize me when,3.1,3.2,3.1
3452,I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours,3.2,3.3,3.2
3453,I am here now because you called for help and noone else would answer,2.9,3.5,3.3
3454,He turned onto the next street and shifted up,3.0,3.0,2.9
3455,Also international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor,2.9,2.9,2.9
3456,Jobs were scarce in other steelexporting countries and labor laws were either nonexistent or allowed employers to pay much less for work,2.7,3.2,3.0
3457,On a worldwide scale newer materials such as aluminum plastic and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad,3.0,2.57,3.0
3458,Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline and it affected both domestic and foreign companies,2.7,3.1,2.8
3459,However to American companies already suffering financial setbacks outdated machinery and fierce competition this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford,2.3,3.1,2.8
3460,Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique,3.0,3.0,3.0
3461,Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry but it was not alone,2.2,3.4,2.6
3462,The problem was a national one involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone,2.4,2.7,2.9
3463,You just can’t solve a nationwide problem in a single city,2.9,3.0,3.3
3464,The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America,2.5,3.1,3.0
3465,Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry,2.71,3.14,3.0
3466,The Save Our Valley Campaign Lack of Funds and Plans,2.5,3.0,3.0
3467,Eventually some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign,3.18,3.0,3.0
3468,As the name suggests local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region,3.11,3.22,3.33
3469,The events that would follow this date known as Black Monday are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope,2.8,2.7,2.7
3470,Marches speeches and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people,3.2,3.1,3.2
3471,But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding,2.6,2.7,2.9
3472,People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds,2.8,2.7,2.9
3473,The lack of money proved to be crippling because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively,2.78,3.0,3.11
3474,Without funds the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy,2.4,2.8,2.8
3475,The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component an actual concrete plan,2.45,2.73,2.82
3476,No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems,2.3,3.1,2.7
3477,People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work the people of Youngstown were after all not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general,3.0,2.8,3.0
3478,Without funds to drive the efforts or even a real plan of action the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good,2.6,3.3,3.1
3479,In effect it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything,2.7,2.7,2.7
3480,People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear but they never did,2.89,3.33,2.89
3481,United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit,3.0,3.0,3.0
3482,Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs,3.0,3.2,3.0
3483,However it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight the international branch was not,3.1,2.8,2.8
3484,The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening,2.4,3.2,3.3
3485,No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before and none of the leaders of USWA not even president Lynn Williams knew what could be done,2.9,2.9,2.8
3486,It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered,2.5,3.2,2.6
3487,Besides incompetence the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart fear of socialism,2.5,2.9,2.9
3488,Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism,2.8,3.0,3.1
3489,If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories then the government and potentially other important people and institutions as well might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism,2.75,3.12,3.25
3490,Regionalism,3.0,2.6,3.0
3491,From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets,3.1,3.0,2.9
3492,Youngstown is the name of the major city area but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself,3.0,3.0,2.9
3493,Petitions protests rallies collectivization and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had,2.44,3.0,3.0
3494,Boardman Poland Township Struthers Lowellville Warren Lordstown Canfield Niles and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown see Figure 3,2.8,2.9,2.9
3495,People from each town work shop eat and socialize in towns separate from their own making each town strongly dependent on every other town,3.0,3.0,3.1
3496,However although traffic is heavy between each separate district each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity educational system heritage history and even food,3.1,3.1,3.0
3497,For example Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population where education is generally better than in surrounding towns but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread,3.0,2.7,3.0
3498,Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist,3.0,2.78,3.11
3499,Two blocks over one finds Boardman a welloff township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools,2.7,2.9,3.1
3500,Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side,3.0,3.1,3.2
3501,With many more cultures religions and economic levels living in close proximity to one another a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area regionalism,3.0,2.5,2.6
3502,Each town with their own identity instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations which dictates many habits exchanges and interactions between populations,3.1,2.7,3.1
3503,Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others,2.2,3.2,2.7
3504,With so much regional tension it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause even one that would save their jobs and their futures,2.62,2.88,3.0
3505,Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing,2.78,3.11,2.89
3506,A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together,2.75,3.25,3.0
3507,In some instances small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate,2.88,3.0,3.12
3508,In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride,2.9,3.2,2.8
3509,These wellintentioned efforts ultimately failed leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind,2.13,3.13,2.75
3510,Conclusion The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday,2.9,2.8,2.7
3511,Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people,2.0,3.72,2.86
3512,The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons the failure of the international steel market the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies,2.7,3.2,3.0
3513,What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level and perhaps it is not,2.9,2.9,3.1
3514,But to the thousands of people living there the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic political and social futures,2.6,3.0,3.0
3515,Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence hundreds of people were uprooted forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities,2.3,3.2,2.7
3516,Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines or even began living on the streets,2.63,3.12,2.75
3517,The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on,3.1,3.2,3.3
3518,Even though they eventually failed the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children,3.1,3.2,2.9
3519,But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail,2.75,2.87,2.75
3520,When examining the area’s history culture and economic situation we can identify four main reasons the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch the lagging international steel market the lack of a clear organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry,2.63,3.12,3.0
3521,Most importantly the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem,2.5,3.37,3.25
3522,A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio,3.12,3.0,3.12
3523,In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township,3.1,3.1,3.1
3524,Their blast furnace Hopewell was the very first blast furnace in the area,2.89,2.89,3.11
3525,During the Civil War Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products,3.11,2.56,3.11
3526,Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads due to its strategic position between Cleveland Pittsburgh New York and Chicago,2.89,3.0,3.0
3527,The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail,2.5,3.2,3.1
3528,In fact More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge a major bridge in Youngstown per day than any other location in the country,3.1,3.0,3.0
3529,During the 19th century the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky,3.0,3.0,3.0
3530,By 1880 Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16000 which meant it had doubled in size over a twentyyear period,3.11,2.89,3.11
3531,The town continued to prosper driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills,3.4,3.0,3.0
3532,This prosperity continued until the late 1920s when the Great Depression hit the area hard,2.62,2.63,3.38
3533,Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union the industry barely survived the Depression years,2.7,2.7,2.8
3534,Finally the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fastpaced period of booming growth,3.3,3.1,3.1
3535,Strikes racked the town during the forties fifties and sixties and they were often long and bloody,2.6,3.2,2.7
3536,This prohibited strikes and lockout angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down,2.44,3.11,2.89
3537,At the same time stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie,3.1,2.8,2.9
3538,Most importantly Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive,2.6,2.7,2.8
3539,September 19 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown Ohio will ever forget,3.0,2.87,3.0
3540,Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry,2.7,2.9,3.0
3541,Between 1977 and 1981 a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25000 jobs were lost countywide,2.4,3.2,3.0
3542,Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement,3.0,3.17,3.33
3543,However it was clear that in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride If you can’t make a buck you get out of the business,3.0,3.3,3.1
3544,On that date Jennings Lambeth president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close,2.2,3.4,2.8
3545,If you can’t make a buck you get out of the business,2.75,3.12,3.5
3546,The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry the end of its population growth and then end of economic progress,2.75,3.0,2.87
3547,Without the mills people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country,2.8,2.9,2.7
3548,Those that could afford to move did so those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets,2.67,3.22,2.89
3549,Without an industrial or a residential base commerce shrank considerably,2.33,3.0,2.89
3550,It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape,2.4,2.9,2.7
3551,The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city and so they mobilized in a variety of ways,3.22,3.44,3.56
3552,Attempts to Save the Mills,3.0,2.9,2.8
3553,The very first thing that the workers could do was to get up a petition to stop the shutdown says Ed Mann a local union leader and organizer,2.9,2.7,3.0
3554,The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power but they refused to support the local union members,2.86,3.0,3.29
3555,The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure,2.5,2.8,3.0
3556,Next workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works,3.14,3.0,2.86
3557,Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area it meant disaster,2.43,3.43,2.57
3558,Lykes ignored the letters so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government,2.75,2.75,3.38
3559,Here too they were ignored,2.2,2.9,2.7
3560,The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed,2.7,3.0,2.5
3561,Finally following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980 local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown,2.9,3.2,3.1
3562,They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene then charged the Headquarters and took it over,3.1,2.9,3.2
3563,The workers stayed there until the next day when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill,2.78,3.0,3.0
3564,Immediately after the workers left the building US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill,2.63,3.0,3.37
3565,All these efforts eventually came to nothing and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed,2.25,2.88,2.62
3566,In fact American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports,2.86,3.14,3.29
3567,Wage hikes although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US made American steel far more expensive,2.56,2.89,3.11

4607,People will read such stories they are worth publishing,3.3,2.9,3.1
4608,Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close,3.0,2.67,3.11
4609,That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct,2.6,3.7,3.9
4610,Why do you write,3.0,2.9,3.1
4611,Why to earn a living I suppose,3.0,2.9,3.1
4612,Why do you ask,3.0,3.14,2.86
4613,You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter though you face such difficulty,2.83,2.83,3.33
4614,I would not be happy thus separated from it,2.2,3.2,2.8
4615,Yes I suppose one could see it thus,3.0,2.9,3.0
4616,But really Nathan your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level,2.43,3.43,3.14
4617,Ignoring the statement Nathan continued,2.8,3.0,3.1
4618,Your writing is for you Allan not for the publishers or some imagined audience,2.9,3.0,3.1
4619,Your stories strike a chord with the deepest most ancient stories of mankind the tales basic to humanity,3.2,3.1,3.2
4620,You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are speak and they shall listen,2.9,3.0,3.0
4621,Allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank,2.7,3.0,2.8
4622,He had filled his pen and raised it the nib descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping of the gnarled primeval willow touching the window with long insistent fingers,3.0,3.0,3.0
4623,His eyes awoke with a passionate determined flame though the only light came from the glutted moon,3.0,3.29,3.0
4624,Where before they had marched in regiments practiced in ranks and followed their leaders commands the words now escaped in their true forms unhindered by any stricture,3.0,2.78,3.0
4625,He continued long into the night until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow raised perpetually skyward,3.0,2.78,3.22
4626,Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye,3.0,3.0,3.11
4627,What is this,2.89,3.0,3.22
4628,he queried indicating the pages he held in his left hand,3.1,3.0,2.9
4629,I decided that since I wasnt having much success with more traditional stories I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,3.12,3.25,3.25
4630,I decided that since I wasnt having much success with more traditional stories I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely Allan replied somewhat less selfassured than he had been the previous night,2.7,3.1,3.0
4631,Although the concept was a simple one Allan thought it had potential,3.2,3.2,3.1
4632,What in Gds name could have possessed you to do such a thing,2.6,3.5,3.1
4633,What in Gds name could have possessed you to do such a thing cried Arthur nearly raising his voice,2.3,3.8,3.3
4634,After all I said the day before why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some selfindulgent fantasy,2.6,3.2,2.7
4635,He shook the papers at Allan raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son,2.8,3.1,3.2
4636,This is nothing but a glorified Grimms tale a miscarried child of Stoker a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant,2.22,3.56,3.67
4637,He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthurs throat,2.36,3.64,2.18
4638,Besides the public liked a good simple romance,3.5,3.2,3.1
4639,Do you hate the modern system of literature,2.8,3.1,2.8
4640,Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare,2.9,2.9,3.2
4641, ,3.0,3.0,2.9
4642,For a moment Allan could hardly do more than shake his head,3.0,2.6,3.0
4643,No of course not I,2.8,3.4,2.9
4644,Then why,2.55,3.18,2.64
4645,do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble this morbid paganistic drivel,2.44,3.22,3.22
4646,Why do you disregard my warnings my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption this literary debauchery,2.4,3.3,2.7
4647,Perhaps this will be more saleable he thought and began to write,3.3,3.2,3.1
4648,Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window,3.0,3.0,2.9
4649,How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door,3.0,3.4,2.9
4650,Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason,2.8,3.1,3.2
4651,A tree forced you to write this my dear Mr Clemm,2.7,3.3,3.3
4652,I must admit this seems farfetched even by your standards even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you,2.8,3.3,3.2
4653,They gazed at each other lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before,3.8,3.9,3.3
4654,You dont know what this is like,2.75,3.25,3.13
4655,You dont know what this is like said Allan shaking his head,2.2,3.4,3.0
4656,Nathan would understand completely,3.25,2.88,3.0
4657,Even as he said it Allan prayed that his statement was true,2.8,2.9,2.7
4658,Very well said Arthur then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you,2.9,3.1,2.9
4659,then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you,2.5,3.17,3.0
4660,If you insist on abandoning me I shall not hold you,2.3,3.4,2.9
4661,Stunned Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order,2.7,3.2,2.8
4662,He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken making his way past his hosts doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathans residence several miles away,2.9,3.0,2.9
4663,At long last Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them,3.0,2.9,2.9
4664,Opening a side drawer he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot,3.0,2.9,3.0
4665,Allan leaned forward unconsciously,2.63,3.12,2.88
4666,What about Roger,3.0,2.9,2.8
4667,Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts,3.3,2.7,2.9
4668,So,2.9,2.9,3.0
4669,So he asked you dont think its a waste of ink and paper a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery,2.8,2.8,3.5
4670,she asked knowing that the answer no longer mattered,2.8,2.8,2.7
4671,Heavens no,2.11,3.56,2.89
4672,Heavens no said Nathan aghast,2.1,3.7,3.3
4673,This is one of the strongest works Ive read in ages,3.8,3.5,3.3
4674,It speaks to the deepest storytellers instinct within us all yet is entirely original,3.1,2.8,3.0
4675,Oh they may rail against you at first they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage but while those in power say such things others will read your tales and see their true worth,3.22,3.22,3.44
4676,Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now,3.1,3.3,3.3
4677,Allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it granted him the encouragement he still needed,3.09,3.36,3.18
4678,Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face,3.36,3.27,3.36
4679,This is good he thought pausing to raise the low light of the lantern,3.2,3.1,3.2
4680,He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight,3.0,2.9,3.1
4681,Certainly it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them,3.0,3.0,3.38
4682,His minds strangest fruit had ripened at last and he found the taste less bitter than expected,3.5,3.12,3.0
4683,These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home,2.8,2.6,3.1
4684,It was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last,3.33,3.33,2.67
4685,Passionate fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead,3.4,3.3,3.2
4686,Im almost done and the happy ending is just falling into place,3.7,3.0,3.3
4687,As Allan drew closer he distinguished a new cloud a pillar rising directly ahead a road of smoke ascended in the west its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door,2.88,3.0,3.0
4688,Allans thoughts fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume,3.0,2.86,3.14
4689,He ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below walking to the carriage parked before Allans house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicles roof,3.0,3.1,3.0
4690,Arthur paused in the door looking up at Allan for a moment then he turned and shut the door behind him,2.62,2.62,2.87
4691,The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on,2.89,3.0,3.11
4692,As they trotted forth Allans eyes remained trapped by the carriage following it up the hillock and past himself,3.0,2.9,3.0
4693,The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows,3.0,3.0,3.0
4694,He watched as the carriage drew still more distant the horses hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway,2.8,2.9,2.9
4695,When they had gone he remained stunned until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself,2.57,3.0,2.71
4696,He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done,2.7,3.5,2.9
4697,Rounding the corner he saw a great bonfire,3.0,3.2,3.0
4698,A mass of flaming wood stood before him heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house,2.67,3.56,2.78
4699,As he thought this a sinuous wind encircled the house slipping through the walls to chill him,2.6,2.8,2.6
4700,It was a moment before he realized what else had changed near the wall beneath his window was a stump with black and ancient bark,2.9,3.1,3.1
4701,In a thoughtless panic Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre,2.4,3.6,2.7
4702,His thoughts were not of the acts futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the trees constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent reminders that he had higher truer things to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake,3.25,3.5,3.37
4703,His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn burning logs but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers,2.2,3.2,2.6
4704,But he did not weep,2.82,2.73,3.09
4705,Instead he bethought himself of the loss of the tree considered also Arthurs motivation and whether some good might not come of this after all,3.0,3.1,3.0
4706,The papers and the lanterns flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allans window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door,2.78,3.33,2.78
4707,Leaving the circle of ashes he stood and turned towards the woods in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood,2.6,3.0,3.0
4708,He stepped slowly beneath the branches a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great swirling eddy a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willows last breath,2.8,2.6,3.1
4709,Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate,2.88,3.0,3.0
4710,And without that torturous willow he might be free to write whatever he saw fit,2.7,2.9,3.0
4711,Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind,3.11,3.11,3.0
4712,He found himself along the bank of a low wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current,3.12,3.0,3.12
4713,As it turned to the deeper woods elder giants rose above him a beech smooth bark a graygreen pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark cracked trunks of the nearer trees great pines a few magnificent specimens still bearing the threestroke symbol of the British King a towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him,3.14,3.14,3.14
4714,This was no stranger however the twisted ancient thing was older than Allan its branches rapping on his window since his childhood,2.9,3.0,3.0
4715,There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass,2.75,2.75,3.0
4716,Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped,2.9,2.8,3.0
4717,Before him roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream grew a stand of black willows,3.2,2.9,3.1
4718,Though the elders trunks fell and died their children first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead continued unabated a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors,2.5,3.0,2.8
4719,Allan stumbled forward jaw slightly slack until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted threetrunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself,2.6,3.2,2.9
4720,After filling his pen Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desks righthand corner,3.0,2.55,2.73
4721,Its thin drawn fingers framed the bloated moon whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly,2.8,3.2,2.9
4722,Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him,2.8,2.9,3.1
4723,In the authors eye gleamed the lanterns reflection or was it a reflection,3.1,3.0,3.0
4724,For while the lanterns spark shivered in the chill breeze this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owners pen scratching out the rhythm of the willows fingers,3.25,2.62,3.0
4725,The frenzied writing ceased at last the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort,3.38,3.25,3.12
4726,After all that so near the end to lose control again,2.11,3.33,2.33
4727,Come darling,3.44,3.11,3.11
4728,Where I am to take you one need never think of those left behind,3.22,3.11,3.67
4729,His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lanterns struggling glow,3.0,2.9,2.8
4730,They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting,3.0,2.9,2.9
4731,For a few yards they kicked up dust along the roadway then they raised their hooves and took to the air,3.14,3.14,3.14
4732,She gaped afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand,2.4,3.3,2.6
4733,The New England woods disappeared even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky,2.46,3.27,2.55
4734,Above them the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached,3.4,3.3,3.1
4735,Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window,2.5,3.5,3.1
4736,Damn you,1.75,4.12,4.0
4737,Damn you he cried will you never leave me be,1.78,3.78,2.45
4738,Shall I never finish a story in peace,2.5,3.1,2.7
4739,He pounded his desk in vain cursing the foul muse that drove him,1.9,3.8,2.8
4740,The next day Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a wellfurnished parlor,3.0,2.89,3.0
4741,Cucumber sandwich,3.2,3.0,3.1
4742,In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial he refilled their glasses,3.0,2.67,3.0
4743,How is the writing these days my dear Mr Clemm,3.38,2.88,3.0
4744,Perfectly dreadful my dear Mr Mason,2.5,3.3,3.1
4745,I had a perfect story in my pages my hero returned home and reclaimed his love I nearly had it tied together before,3.7,3.6,3.2
4746,Before,3.1,3.0,3.0
4747,Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others thank Heaven,3.12,3.12,3.25
4748,Arthurs face assumed a longsuffering aspect of authoritative exasperation,2.37,3.25,2.63
4749,Its far from a penchant Arthur,2.9,2.9,3.4
4750,Arthur grimaced at the vivid description,2.6,3.3,3.0
4751,The Black Willow,2.89,2.67,3.11
4752,Im sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption,2.6,3.1,3.0
4753,I know Allan replied but how am I to do that,2.8,3.0,2.6
4754,but how am I to do that,2.7,2.7,2.8
4755,You know I do not wish to make my stories thus but it is my nemesis confronting me anew at every turn,2.37,3.25,2.75
4756,Arthur raised a critical brow,2.4,3.2,2.8
4757,Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal and believe me Allan you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish,2.71,3.29,3.14
4758,Allan unfolded another page this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right,3.0,3.1,3.1
4759,It is true,3.0,2.7,3.2
4760,that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher,2.44,3.22,3.0
4761,Ive even tried rewriting the corrupted sections but once my characters have gone down that road nothing can recall their former life,2.63,2.88,3.25
4762,My prodigal inkblooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road,2.91,3.0,3.0
4763,If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours you might write something really worth reading,2.83,3.0,3.67
4764,Its hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd,2.6,3.1,3.0
4765,Allan hung his head holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees,2.38,3.12,2.75
4766,His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had a rumpled look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his weariness,2.3,2.8,2.4

4811,Ive visited plenty of farmtofork restaurants and this one may be the best Ive seen at selfmarketing,3.6,3.0,3.0
4812,Theres nothing wrong with it the food in those jars is probably delicious though I question whether the 10 tupelo honey had to come from Florida or if its produced locally,3.0,3.0,2.9
4813,Some of that is surely due to good marketing but the real reason for its popularity is this,3.0,2.8,3.1
4814,That sandwich was so good I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely,4.0,3.56,3.34

5502,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE OFFICE OF THE DEAN,3.1,2.6,3.1
5503,Over the past year the Graduate School of Arts and Science has seen record level contributions from its alumni and alumnae to the School’s Annual Fund,3.6,3.3,3.1
5504,This response is a marvelous endorsement of the work of our students faculty and staff,3.6,3.3,3.0
5505,As you read the enclosed Dean s Report and Request I hope you will consider how your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund shapes the lives of its faculty and students as it makes an impact on the depth and breadth of their NYU experience,3.4,3.1,3.3
5506,However it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution Warren 2002 159 172,3.0,2.6,3.0
5507,Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone England 2003 733,2.9,3.0,2.9
5508,Nonetheless in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion,3.0,3.0,3.0
5509,Within the panMayan movement there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity some view the reduction of their language to the status of dialect devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world however despite differences over standardization the panMayan movement itself is largely cohesive,3.0,3.0,3.14
5510,An example is the Tukanoans while considered a single ethnic group they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy in which members of one language group must marry into another Jackson 1995 4,3.2,3.1,3.0
5511,Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture,3.1,3.0,3.2
5512,Indigenous cosmology or cosmovision is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages it maintains a concept of culture defined as the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature Gow and Rappaport 2002 58 and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought,2.9,2.7,3.0
5513,Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and nongovernmental organizations,3.0,2.86,3.0
5514,The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with,2.9,2.9,2.9
5515,Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia,3.11,3.33,3.22
5516,Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony crimes are viewed as imbalances in the communitys harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime but may have influenced the accused to do so,2.7,3.0,2.9
5517,When a punishment often public and corporal in nature is carried out the group feels the effects as a whole,2.57,3.0,3.0
5518,Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence sharing in their ordeal,3.0,2.91,3.09
5519,Rappaport 2005 Once punishments are completed the criminal is seen as rehabilitated having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order and is welcomed back into the community Gow and Rappaport 2002 61 Rappaport 2005 97,3.0,2.9,3.0
5520,Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision,2.9,2.9,3.0
5521,The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution but to recapture its spirit in a native rather than Western discourse Gow and Rappaport 2002 5859,3.2,3.0,3.1
5522,This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing Rappaport 2005 93 236,2.9,2.8,3.2
5523,Translation fulfills another vital role as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself,3.25,2.87,3.12
5524,Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries,2.88,2.75,3.0
5525,The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten Rappaport 2005 165,2.9,2.8,2.9
5526,This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use,2.9,2.5,2.9
5527,Difficulties arise however as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop,2.8,2.9,3.0
5528,Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use,2.9,3.1,2.9
5529,The authenticity of the modern Nasa who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots is brought into question by the traditional who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existenceRappaport 2005,2.8,2.7,3.2
5530,In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so,3.1,3.1,3.1
5531,Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions which most often occurs under Spanish influence,2.89,3.0,3.11
5532,A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic Indianness both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture,2.9,2.8,3.0
5533,Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself,2.9,2.9,3.1
5534,Efforts towards development then can not endanger traditional culture and values for fear of losing cultural legitimacy Jackson 1995 5,3.0,2.7,2.7
5535,There develops a duality in native culture for example many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom,3.1,2.8,2.8
5536,This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed,2.9,2.6,3.1
5537,In Colombia legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian governments recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not Jackson 1995 8,3.0,3.0,2.9
5538,Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws Jackson 1995 5,3.0,2.88,3.38
5539,Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the everpersist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment,2.8,3.0,3.1
5540,Works Cited,2.9,2.9,2.9
5541,The effects of Spanish colonialism are both farreaching and deeply embedded in both countries,2.86,2.86,3.14
5542,One of the most prominent lasting influences is that of the land grant system Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land,2.9,2.7,2.8
5543,This was in turn replaced by the repartimento the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish providing labor and taxes as demanded,2.9,3.2,3.0
5544,The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century,3.29,3.14,3.0
5545,Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations previously both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture,3.1,3.0,3.2
5546,However they also claimed that they were part of a larger group the working class whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a workerfriendly one Jackson 1995 67,3.11,3.22,3.22

5548,A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response,2.4,3.2,2.8
5549,This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture a group of people joined by characteristics traits and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity discernible from that of those outside them those who do not belong,3.09,2.91,3.0
5550,This resulted in persecution against the Mayans who make up about 60 of the overall population In both counties guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples in many cases there were coalitions but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote inaccessible villages as hideouts,2.6,3.1,3.2
5551,In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed 200000 Mayans were killed and over 1 million more were displaced,2.2,3.1,3.1
5552,The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord Warren 2002 157158,3.2,3.0,3.0
5553,By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen and indigenous rights movements formed Warren 2003 174 Jackson 2002 82,2.9,2.8,3.1
5554,Central to these was the question of indigenous identity,3.0,2.8,2.9
5555,PanMayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language despite local dialectical differences it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people,3.1,2.9,2.9
5556,Most still speak it in various forms and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent modern version of Maya England 2003 733 739,3.1,3.1,3.1
5557,PanMayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity it largely avoids specifically political overtones instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture England 2003 734,3.0,2.6,2.8
5558,The popular left however continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool,2.62,2.75,3.12
5559,The PanMayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the often negative attention of the government England 2003 735 Warren 2003 181,2.9,3.3,3.1
5560,Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things clothing food lifestyle choices,3.0,3.0,3.0
5561,This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior,2.9,2.9,3.2
5562,PanMayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance a language of power and prestige England 2003 736,3.0,2.83,3.0
5563,By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority,3.0,2.9,3.0
5564,Colombia in contrast has no unified panIndian sentiments the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population a fractured entity divided by region and language,3.0,2.5,3.0
5565,Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed the ONIC poses itself as the sole panIndian group yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples Jackson 2002 83 85,3.0,2.8,3.0
5566,The CRIC which focuses on language development and renewal is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples Jackson 2003 82,3.0,2.62,3.0
5567,Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups Jackson 2002 109,3.0,3.0,3.0
5568,This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other,3.3,3.0,3.3
5569,The command of a language while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it is often the key to gaining entry,3.12,2.38,3.0
5570,A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991 which includes a section on indigenous rights as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups Gow and Rappaport 2002 57,3.12,2.75,3.12
5571,Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty,2.9,2.6,3.1
5572,They are ruled by the cabildo local governing boards formed of community leaders Gow and Rappaport 2002 5152,3.0,2.6,3.0
5573,The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity,3.0,3.0,3.0
5574,no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era,3.1,2.9,2.9
5575,In turn communal identity can be formed around a language it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers,3.1,3.1,3.1
5576,The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature Gow and Rappaport 2002 5758,3.0,2.6,3.1
5577,The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999,2.6,3.2,2.8
5578,From beginners to experts they are into hiking camping and backpacking crosscountry skiing and snowshoeing rock climbing and mountaineering canoeing kayaking and bicycling nature photography and birdwatching and relaxing alongside nature,3.12,2.75,3.25

5647,Because the ASPCA and the thousands of animals we help every year need all the friends we can get,3.2,3.3,3.1
5648,As a person who cares about animals you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro,2.75,3.0,3.12
5649,A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate,2.71,3.0,3.29
5650,When our officers arrived Astro was too weak to even stand up,2.63,3.0,2.63
5651,The officers knelt down slowly speaking gently to the emaciated dog,2.67,2.78,2.78
5652,Then they saw it,3.1,3.3,3.2
5653,Astro was wagging his tail,3.78,3.56,3.0
5654,He was barely moving,2.6,2.7,2.5
5655,but yes the poor sick dog was saying,2.38,3.0,2.88
5656,Welcome friends,3.8,3.8,3.2
5657,The dog weighted only 45 pounds less than half of what a dog his size should weigh and he had several infections,2.11,3.11,2.67
5658,But with firstrate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff he slowly got well again,3.7,3.3,3.0
5659,Stories like Astro’s are all too common,3.0,2.7,2.9
5660,Every day the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty abuse and neglect,2.11,3.22,3.11
5661,Every day our officers rescue animals like Sammy a 10monthold kitten who was deliberately thrown from a highrise window by teenagers,2.6,3.2,3.2

5665,His belly was empty,2.6,2.7,3.1
5666,And we don’t stop there,3.2,3.3,3.4
5667,At least Astro could drink water from a puddle near the stake he was chained to,2.7,3.1,2.9
5668,Since the ASPCA was founded in 1866 as America’ s first humane society ending cruelty has been our primary goal,3.5,3.1,3.2
5669,Today over 130 years later the scope of the problem is greater than ever,2.36,3.27,2.73
5670,The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back the tide of violence against animals,2.44,3.89,3.22

5713,Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake and how this could set a dangerous precedent First of all you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm,2.5,2.88,3.25
5714,Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slowacting poison spread in fields miles away,2.14,3.57,3.0
5715,So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a scientific experiment to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss,2.9,2.7,3.2
5716,scientific experiment,3.0,2.82,3.0
5717,Can you believe it,3.14,3.43,3.14
5718,experiment,2.9,2.8,3.0
5719,And if the death of two million birds doesn’t prove their theory and show a reduction in crop loss they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year,2.6,3.5,3.1
5720,prove,3.0,3.0,3.2
5721,It’s time to tell the USDA in no uncertain terms,3.0,2.89,3.33
5722,Because the USDA’s slowacting pesticide takes three days to kill its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields before falling to the ground,2.2,3.5,2.8
5723,Meanwhileblackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison,2.7,3.1,3.1
5724,In all nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon’s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields,2.78,3.11,2.89
5725,We simply can not afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife,2.7,3.1,2.9
5726,I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago,3.6,3.7,3.5
5727,But today’s battle is one we must win to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment,2.88,3.62,3.37
5728,That’s why I hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a taxdeductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds other wildlife and habitat,3.0,3.14,3.0
5729,And with a donation of 15 or more you’ll receive a FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern,3.3,3.1,3.1
5730,I’ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to,3.2,2.9,3.0

5736,The US Department of Agriculture,3.2,3.4,3.0
5737,Audubon protects birds,3.5,3.0,3.2

5739,With your help Audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded properly implemented and strongly enforced,3.14,3.0,3.0
5740,In fact the USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern Great Plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly 70 other bird species,2.2,3.2,2.6
5741,Audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries,3.46,3.0,3.36
5742,Audubon is truly making a difference for wildlife refuges everywhere,3.7,3.2,3.0
5743,I’m outraged,1.63,3.91,3.45
5744,Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage,3.1,3.2,3.4
5745,Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands,3.3,3.2,3.1
5746,Audubon educates the public,3.3,3.1,3.3
5747,Teaching Americans particularly young people how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and I can make for wildlife,3.4,3.4,3.5
5748,That’s why we’re expanding our network of Audubon Centers to reach children and adults in every corner of the nation,3.33,3.22,3.44
5749,And of course your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges like the USDA’s bird poisoning proposal that I’m asking you to help us defeat today,3.1,3.3,3.3
5750,So let me urge you to do your part by supporting a group that the San Francisco Chronicle calls one of America’s most respected and influential conservation organizations,3.0,2.9,3.2

5795,Medicine for ones mind,3.0,3.0,3.1
5796,He began by telling us Do not take any of what I say on faith,3.1,3.1,3.0
5797,Do not take any of what I say on faith Take it through analysis if there is some benefit in it for you,3.0,2.9,3.6
5798,Take it through analysis if there is some benefit in it for you,3.0,3.1,3.1
5799,Religion he said is like a drugstore full of medicine,2.9,2.7,3.1
5800,You do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in ityou just buy what would be beneficial to you now,3.0,3.1,3.2
5801,You believe the other medicine may have just as much value but in other situations not this one,3.0,2.64,2.91
5802,When we talked about the giving and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings in the form of material items kind words protection and so on Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat,2.92,3.0,2.83
5803,The gentle wind makes them flutter,3.2,2.9,3.0
5804,So,3.0,2.7,3.0
5805,So a fellow student asked Giving ones life for another being is the ultimate gift,2.9,3.1,3.0
5806,Giving ones life for another being is the ultimate gift,3.0,3.0,2.8
5807,Only if you feel no regret,3.0,3.0,3.1

5813,Selfpreservation above all else unless the right situation arises,3.1,3.2,3.2
5814,Knowing and understanding,3.0,3.0,3.0
5815,Later I talked to the resident nun Ani Kunga about psychology and cognitive science,3.0,3.0,3.0
5816,She had studied psychology for a while in grad school but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way,3.0,3.0,2.9
5817,Psychologists,2.9,2.8,3.2
5818,Psychologists she said study the brain and the self externally,3.0,3.0,3.0
5819,But the mind can only be known by you the person whose mind it is,3.0,2.8,3.2
5820,She said philosophy and epistemology were doing it right looking at experiences from the inside,3.0,2.75,2.92
5821,A big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism psychology and cognitive science,3.0,3.0,3.2
5822,Tsechen Kunchab Ling Temple of AllEncompassing Great Compassion,3.0,3.0,2.9
5823,But this doesnt mean that there isnt merit to such studies nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way,3.0,3.0,3.1
5824,During a second philsophy session Khenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha,3.0,3.0,3.0
5825,This sutra delved into some questions about the nature of the self whether the self is a delusion and how the clinging of self is a defilement,2.9,3.1,3.0
5826,I intend to discuss it in more depth later so stay tuned,3.1,2.8,3.4
5827,This is the seat of His Holiness the Sakya Trizin in the United States a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago,3.0,3.0,3.0

5830,Sunshine melted lazily through the tree branches above a breeze animating the branches shadows so they danced between our cushions,3.5,3.0,2.8
5831,The key message,3.0,2.8,3.1
5832,If theres something you can do why are you unhappy Just do it If theres nothing you can do why are you unhappy,2.8,3.3,3.2
5833,Just do it,3.1,3.3,3.9
5834,If theres nothing you can do why are you unhappy,2.8,3.2,3.0
5835,Ani Kunga explained several offsession and one onsession technique for dealing with negative emotions anger hate irritation stress jealousy and so on,3.1,2.9,3.1
5836,Stay tuned for a more indepth post on the topic,3.0,2.8,3.0
5837,Another of the days activities was making prayer flags,3.08,3.0,2.92
5838,As Ani Kunga explained Prayers wishes hopes aspirationssomeone many people may share those with you,3.3,3.3,3.0
5839,Prayers wishes hopes aspirationssomeone many people may share those with you Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in the world This may do no good at all but it mayif everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires perhaps it will do good It may not But if no one shares their prayers it will certainly do no good So on the offchance that it will help why not,3.1,3.1,2.9
5840,Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in the world,3.2,3.0,3.1
5841,This may do no good at all but it mayif everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires perhaps it will do good,3.4,3.4,3.2
5842,It may not,3.0,3.0,3.0
5843,But if no one shares their prayers it will certainly do no good,2.6,2.9,3.2
5844,So on the offchance that it will help why not,3.2,2.9,2.9
5845,Never done,2.58,2.67,2.67
5846,This weekend reminded me that Im not done learning,3.2,3.2,2.7
5847,I spent the past weekend there,3.09,2.73,2.82
5848,If I stay still long enough if Ive achieved a relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and approaches and incorporate beneficial ones into my life,3.2,3.2,3.2
5849,A person is never done and so Ill continue to observe and discuss and study trying to pick the directions in which Ill change and trying to make tomorrow better than today,3.17,3.08,3.0
5850,done,2.9,3.0,3.2
5851,Ever onward and ever upward,3.2,3.2,3.1
5852,Faded squares of fabric strung together in repeating bluewhiteredgreenyellow chains crisscross the branches of barelimbed trees,2.9,2.7,2.9
5853,Everyone Ive talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it this semester one of my friends told me she was going I should join her,3.4,3.3,3.0
5854,I like learning new things so I signed up,3.6,3.4,3.3
5855,A good decision I didnt return all chill and zen as one friend told me his roommate had but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over and dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world,3.1,3.3,3.1
5856,They suggested that what you believe about selfcontrol affects the goals you set and achieve PDF,3.0,2.9,3.2
5857,Im not one to make New Years resolutions,3.0,2.7,3.1
5858,In the paper selfcontrol is used to mean a sense of willpower,3.0,2.8,3.1
5859,selfcontrol,2.9,2.9,3.6
5860,Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of selfcontrol noting that the amount of selfcontrol a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed the amount of selfcontrol a person has can change over time or not,3.0,2.9,3.1
5861,I mean sure I could take my pick of popular New Years resolutions I could decide on the first day of the new year that this year Ill start exercising more and eating better or that Ill spend more time with my family and friends or that Ill learn a new skill,3.1,3.3,3.1
5862,An important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained,3.1,3.3,3.2
5863,So if you think youll be able to achieve a goal youre more likely to set it,3.3,2.9,3.2
5864,Combine this with theories of selfcontrol and in general if you believe you have unlimited stores of selfcontrol youll set a larger number of goals,3.1,3.2,3.3
5865,Mukhopadhyay Venkatarmani also discuss selfefficacy belief in ones capabilities the perceived ability to carry out a desired action,3.0,3.0,3.1
5866,Selfcontrol Selfefficacy and New Years Resolutions Unresolved,2.9,3.0,2.9
5867,The studies,3.0,2.8,3.0
5868,In the first study 85 participants all college students each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of selfcontrol,3.0,2.7,3.1
5869,Each passage contained two paragraphs the first discussed selfcontrol either as limited or as unlimited and the second discussed selfcontrol as either malleable or fixed,3.1,3.1,3.0
5870,The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation in which they listed all their current goals,3.1,2.8,3.1
5871,The experimenters had some concerns about participants natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read however so in study two the order of the two measures lay theories and motivationgoal listing was varied,2.9,2.9,3.0
5872,Data from 130 new participants revealed that as hypothesized if the motivation goals questionnaire were assessed first then among the people who believed selfcontrol is malleable those who also believed selfcontrol to be unlimited vs,3.0,3.0,3.09
5873,limited set more goals,3.0,3.0,3.3
5874,When lay theories were assessed first this result reversed,3.0,2.9,3.0
5875,The people who believed that selfcontrol is fixed were unaffected by order,3.0,3.1,3.2
5876,The third study moved on to examine goal achievement adding a measure to look at selfefficacy,3.1,3.0,3.0
5877,The study had two sessions in November then February,3.0,2.6,3.0
5878,In the first session the 159 participants read passages about lay theories much like in study one but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions and filled out individual difference measures which included a selfefficacy scale,2.9,2.9,3.0
5879,And if I chose to make resolutions Id be far from alonea 2008 survey on Dorthycom found that 66 of the 2000+ adults polled had made resolutions at some point though only 17 managed to keep them,2.9,2.9,3.2
5880,Only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions,3.2,3.0,3.0
5881,What does this mean for your resolutions,3.0,2.8,3.0
5882,The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar take a look at any list of popular New Years resolutions and youll see the majority of the goals,3.0,2.7,3.0
5883,As shown in the first two studies more goals were set by people who believe selfcontrol is unlimited and malleable than by any other peoplethat is if you expect more success you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself,3.0,2.7,3.1
5884,Selfefficacy did not have a significant effect on goalsetting,2.9,3.0,3.1
5885,As far as success goes only the interaction between lay theory and selfefficacy was significant,2.9,2.9,3.0
5886,If participants believed in limited selfcontrol and were low in selfefficacy they tended to give up more often failing to achieve their goals,2.7,2.9,3.1
5887,But in general lay theories about selfcontrol can determine how much success youll expect and thus how many goals youll set and selfefficacy beliefs can determine how much success youll actually have,3.1,3.3,3.1

5910,You wan na play robots Roy asked,3.14,3.0,3.14
5911,You wan na play robots,3.0,2.9,2.9
5912,Chad felt his heart beat a little faster and his cheeks burned,3.0,3.8,2.8
5913,He had invented the robots game to make fun of Roy but Roy had never figured that out either,2.78,2.67,2.89
5914,Roy stooped to pick up a big white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad,3.0,2.9,3.1
5915,It was Roys favorite game,3.43,2.86,3.14

5921,He took another careful look over his shoulder and bent to pluck a yucca spear as if that were what drew his interest,3.0,3.11,2.89

5923,The hot August sun was settling toward the time that Mrs Rayburn would bring the milk tray out of the cinder block building where the toddlers and babies were kept,2.8,2.7,3.0
5924,Meanwhile Roy stalked around the fence edge bending to pick cockleburs as he went,2.9,2.8,2.7
5925,Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes,2.4,3.1,3.0
5926,Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange like a remote control boy,3.1,3.0,3.1
5927,When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap Chad had called him Remote Control Boy,3.25,3.12,3.12
5928,Momma had smacked Chad for saying it which hurt and then she had cried which was worse,2.2,3.2,2.7
5929,Pop had given Chad the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home,2.8,3.0,2.7
5930,Chad just hung his head,2.4,3.1,2.5
5931,The doctors have put something very special in Roys brain,3.1,3.4,2.9
5932,Its something they made for soldiers and astronauts and its going to help Roy walk and talk to us again,3.2,3.2,3.1
5933,Chad was six and at eight Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something,2.78,3.11,3.33
5934,How are you feeling Roy,3.0,2.8,2.9
5935,They all stood around while the doctor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with a sick sound,2.25,3.62,2.75
5936,But the thing in his head hadnt worked yet because of something having to do with the electric toads which wouldnt sit up,2.7,2.8,3.0
5937,Now this year Roy was in the same grade as Chad and it was embarrassing,2.5,3.1,3.0
5938,Roy stepped around the edge of the building and out of sight,2.9,2.9,3.0
5939,Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster,3.0,3.3,3.0
5940,Tucker was big even for a third grader and he was not quite right in a different way than Roy,2.8,3.0,3.1
5941,Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground and the one who decided the rules of the game,2.9,2.9,2.7
5942,Were not ready yet,2.8,3.2,2.8
5943,No time outs Tucker shouted and continued to climb down the tires,2.9,3.2,3.5
5944,Several more boys spewed out after him,2.78,2.89,2.67
5945,Roy,3.5,3.9,3.4
5946,Roy Chad called but his voice would only whisper,2.7,3.4,2.7
5947,He didnt want to be a crybaby Tucker hated crybabies,2.25,3.25,2.62
5948,The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag,3.0,3.0,3.0
5949,From painful experience he knew it wasnt going to be as easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything,2.4,3.1,2.9
5950,Going down too easy would only make him mad so Chad reached behind him to grab the five stickers he had managed to collect before the start of the game and readied himself,3.0,3.11,3.22
5951,The boys came in quick from all sides knocking Chad down but he managed to roll to his feet and get one sticker off into a boys arm before being knocked down again,2.7,3.3,3.2
5952,Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust,2.56,3.11,3.56
5953,Baby,3.6,3.5,3.2
5954,Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun,3.0,3.3,3.1
5955,You didnt fight,2.2,3.8,3.2
5956,Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasnt a baby to Tucker,2.88,3.25,2.75
5957,Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chads face,2.38,3.25,2.62
5958,Im gon na take the plug out,3.0,2.75,3.25
5959,Then Tuckers face became serious,2.62,3.12,3.0
5960,Now Chads legs and arms and mouth worked and he was up and running and screaming Roy go inside Roy,2.67,3.33,3.22
5961,Roy go inside,3.0,3.56,3.44
5962,He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared,2.56,3.56,3.33
5963,The door was on that side and Mrs Rayburn,3.0,2.86,3.0
5964,Just then a horrible pain stung Chads cheek and neck and ear,2.3,3.6,2.8
5965,The tumbleweeds yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face,2.36,3.18,2.63
5966,He wished he were there now even if he did have to sit next to Roy,2.9,3.0,2.8
5967,Tucker made a grab for him but missed it and Chad heard his shirt rip a little,2.7,3.2,3.0
5968,He ran like only a small boy can run but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly,3.0,3.0,2.63
5969,Roy,3.3,3.9,3.2
5970,Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the tumbleweed from behind and the world slowed almost to a stop,2.82,3.55,2.91
5971,Roy stood with the bill of his cap down,2.78,2.67,3.0
5972,His head rose and his eyes focused over Chads shoulder,3.0,3.14,3.0
5973,Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground,3.2,2.8,3.0
5974,His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up,2.6,3.3,2.9
5975,Something whined as it spun past Chads ear and he heard a sharp meaty thunk just behind him,2.9,3.2,2.9
5976,The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork,3.36,2.91,3.18
5977,Hey Roy,3.1,3.1,3.0
5978,Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chads back,3.0,3.29,3.29
5979,A sharp flat flint rock split Tuckers forehead and was buried deep and solid like a part of a Halloween costume complete with a drop of blood just starting down toward his nose,2.2,3.4,2.7
5980,Tucker dropped down like a jacket from a hook,2.75,2.88,3.0
5981,It was Roy and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes,3.0,2.8,3.0
5982,Yeah,3.1,3.1,2.8
5983,Chad stepped back away from Tuckers openeyed face,2.82,2.91,2.82
5984,I thought he might stab you Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tuckers face as the other boys began to crowd around at a respectful distance,2.3,3.4,3.1
5985,Do you think hes dead,2.6,3.4,2.7
5986,Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob,1.84,3.17,3.0
5987,Nah Chad said Were gon na be in trouble,2.62,3.12,2.87
5988,Nah,2.75,2.88,2.75
5989,Were gon na be in trouble,2.3,3.2,2.8
5990,Yeah,3.09,3.09,3.18
5991,Hey Roy,3.11,3.0,2.89
5992,What,3.0,3.12,3.0
5993,You suck,2.0,3.57,3.86
5994,It was all right,3.3,2.8,3.3
5995,The fort was a lone wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends each the size of a dinner table,3.0,2.83,3.17
5996,The sufferer says no only those which cause no pain,2.9,2.5,3.0
5997,And the artist says no only those which cause the most pain for those would be the truest memories,2.6,2.9,3.1
5998,So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise,3.18,2.82,3.73
5999,I will not talk of the first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together,2.8,2.8,3.3
6000,I can remember similar things with others,3.0,3.0,3.12
6001,Is that love,3.0,3.0,2.86
6002,But it is something marvelous and rare which is surely a sign of love,4.0,3.71,3.43
6003,If my love for her was the only important thing I would leave a holo of her with a note Dear Future this is Tasha Cortez,3.2,3.2,3.2
6004,Dear Future this is Tasha Cortez,3.25,2.88,3.0
6005,With warmest regards Your Past,3.6,3.2,3.2
6006,Enough,2.78,3.11,3.22
6007,Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together and I decided to buy it,3.3,3.3,3.3
6008,Mama kept her mink jacket a family handmedown safe from time in a stopbox and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection,3.1,2.7,3.2
6009,Then,3.0,2.8,3.0
6010,This is not easy,2.29,2.86,2.71
6011,I stand up I walk around I pretend someone makes a vid about a writer and I must enact every cliche,2.89,2.89,3.0
6012,But I have learned something writing trivializes,3.0,2.88,3.25
6013,The Tasha who was is not the Tasha in this file,3.0,2.86,2.86
6014,The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I knew,2.1,3.1,2.9
6015,she,3.0,2.7,3.0
6016,Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV,2.91,2.63,2.82
6017,I must also write about Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez,3.0,3.1,3.2
6018,Future Self you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between the last sentence and this,3.1,3.1,3.2
6019,I have been rereading all our favorite books,3.33,3.11,3.22
6020,Published in Double Feature by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly NESFA Press 1994,3.1,3.1,3.1
6021,But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects do we,3.14,3.0,3.29
6022,I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo and then for the sake of literary convenience to say that from a corner of the yard I saw a neighboring house and the sight filled me with darkest forebodings,2.5,3.3,2.8
6023,But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where it could barely be seen and I only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with understated good taste,2.7,3.4,3.2
6024,Who lives there,3.0,3.1,2.9
6025,I asked,3.0,2.75,3.38
6026,No one,2.6,3.0,3.2
6027,No one Tasha replied,2.86,2.86,3.14
6028,Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release usually a few hours after enclosing it,3.0,3.1,2.7
6029,Truth is always more boring than fiction,2.8,2.7,3.2
6030,For Malaquez did not move into Dreams End until four or five months after I we,2.9,2.9,2.9
6031,I do not plan to write a book this narrative must move more quickly,3.0,3.11,3.11
6032,Tasha and I became lovers that evening after a good dinner of paella at her apartment,3.7,3.8,3.2
6033,I made some small joke afterward about approving of her firms business incentives and she cried,2.5,3.25,3.12
6034,Consoling her I began to suspect I loved her,3.29,3.14,3.43
6035,I moved into The Flamingo the next day and she gave up her apartment three weeks later to join me,3.1,3.1,3.2
6036,It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all the sort of romance that sustains the hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love,3.4,3.0,2.9
6037,Which is to say you and me Future Self,3.0,3.0,3.11
6038,Who was Tasha Cortez,3.0,3.14,3.0
6039,She was a twentyfouryearold Terran Standard NApulcan who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunts real estate firm,3.0,2.9,3.0

6041,Tasha said she woke up one morning convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables she would become one,2.75,3.0,2.88
6042,She did not like my plays,2.3,2.7,2.7
6043,I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing and not as I had hoped because I was a great artist,3.4,3.2,3.3
6044,That bothered yes and intrigued me until I realized that she was bored by most plays movies and vid,2.8,3.3,2.9
6045,She did not like being a spectator,2.6,2.9,3.0
6046,I often told her that she should have a biocheck to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance,3.0,3.0,3.1
6047,I often told her too many things,2.7,2.9,2.7
6048,Search Emiliano Malaquez and youll find hes a master of the captured moment school of sculpture,3.1,2.8,3.2
6049,Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work,3.37,3.0,3.37
6050,To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models,3.0,2.7,2.9
6051,He accents the illusion of reality I paraphrase his entry in La Enciclopedia Humanica by doing lifesize scenes in the full round never the easier frontal or threequarters view,2.86,3.14,2.86
6052,Moreover he never did portraits of famous people his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it,3.0,2.8,2.8
6053,As is typical of his school his pieces are sealed in stopboxes,2.9,2.7,3.3
6054,The shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that were looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time,3.0,3.1,3.1
6055,Yes Self I am also bothered that this observation ignores halfeaten cheese sandwiches incomplete insect collections and locks of infants hair forgotten in closets basements and warehouses,2.73,3.18,3.0

6060,I have disguised us in the play and deleted one brief melodramatic interchange,3.0,3.0,3.1
6061,I took mine home where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play,3.22,2.78,3.33
6062,Now I will mention it in case IYou decide to restore it,3.22,3.22,3.33

6232,My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash fire,3.0,2.82,3.18
6233,Be glad someone didnt toss that to you,3.29,3.0,3.14
6234,He spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of a sevenyearold,3.8,3.5,3.1
6235,Um I should wait to importune you but,3.0,3.0,2.83
6236,A confession and then a request,2.9,2.9,3.0
6237,Its not easy for me to ask a favor,2.83,3.17,2.67
6238,Relax,3.6,2.7,3.0
6239,Relax I said,2.9,2.5,3.2
6240,Its easy for me to turn one down,3.2,2.7,3.4
6241,The surprising thing is that I was,3.0,3.14,3.29
6242,Good,4.2,3.3,3.1
6243,My last show,2.7,3.0,3.1
6244,was glorious,4.0,3.9,3.3
6245,Tasha said,3.0,2.87,3.25
6246,was kindly received,3.5,3.12,3.0
6247,was kindly received he said,3.3,3.0,2.9
6248,Oh,3.0,3.25,2.88
6249,I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays,2.9,3.0,3.0
6250,No more urchins dopers vagrants or whores,2.8,3.1,3.3
6251,He spoke quickly prepared to be rejected,2.25,3.5,2.75
6252,Would you permit me to do one of you,3.1,3.0,2.4
6253,I would pay,3.1,2.9,3.1
6254,Never,2.5,3.5,3.63
6255,Never I said,2.25,3.88,3.75
6256,Ah,3.0,2.62,3.0
6257,He shrugged lightly,3.0,3.0,3.0
6258,Nardo,3.0,3.6,3.3
6259,Its an honor,4.0,3.2,3.2
6260,Of course I said,3.11,3.0,3.22
6261,Thats why I can not take payment,2.86,2.86,3.43
6262,Oh,3.0,3.1,3.1
6263,Oh,3.29,3.71,3.14
6264,Thank you,3.88,3.62,2.75
6265,Malaquez turned to Tasha,3.0,2.8,2.9
6266,And you as well,3.12,3.0,3.0
6267,Perhaps the two of you together,3.0,3.2,2.8
6268,Her eyes became circles at the idea of being as she undoubtedly thought it immortalized by Emil Malaquez,3.4,3.2,3.0
6269,Oh,3.0,2.88,3.0
6270,My God yes yes yes,4.3,4.4,3.4
6271,For a perfect moment Emil and Tasha and I were one entity laughing until our lungs hurt,4.38,3.88,3.13
6272,This is torture,1.67,3.67,2.44
6273,I had not considered that I might not write to learn but to punish myself,2.14,3.0,2.86
6274,Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in a few sentences After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder lobsters boiled on Terra and unstopped still steaming on NApulco and cinnamon custard for desert,3.0,2.7,3.0

6276,She had studied it in school so she thought herself as an expert,3.1,2.9,2.9
6277,I once had a neighbor who played it constantly loudly and badly so I thought I knew it better,2.5,3.0,3.0
6278,So I think did she,3.0,2.64,3.09
6279,The subject shifted from music to Tashas obsession with fame undoubtedly by a leap that I made,3.1,3.0,3.0
6280,She had no choice but to follow,2.8,2.6,2.8
6281,I do not remember any of this well just now nor do I care to,2.5,3.0,3.0
6282,Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of Captured Moments,3.1,2.8,3.0
6283,Malaquez glanced away embarrassed,2.4,3.2,2.7
6284,I will,3.33,3.0,3.0
6285,I feel sorry for you Nardo,2.38,3.12,2.88
6286,Ill see Emil home,3.0,3.0,3.3
6287,Yes,3.4,3.2,3.0
6288,Yes I said Do that and did not care what she did or why,3.0,3.29,3.0
6289,Do that,3.12,3.0,3.38
6290,Emil asked Youre all right,2.8,3.1,2.9
6291,Youre all right,2.91,3.27,2.91
6292,I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent,3.0,3.0,3.0
6293,They both walked up to Emils home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves,3.0,3.2,3.2
6294,Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep,2.14,3.29,2.86
6295,She had not come home when I woke in midmorning,2.1,3.0,2.7
6296,I waited and drank a glass of MorningAfter and three cups of coffee and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night and whether I wanted it to,2.5,3.1,2.8
6297,Perhaps I should have invited Emil to stay but even then I knew that sex was not the problem between Tasha and me,2.7,2.8,2.7
6298,The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation between symbols and substance,2.75,3.0,3.0
6299,Shortly before noon I climbed the sandy path to Dreams End rehearsing my apology slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet,2.6,2.9,2.8
6300,Malaquez answered the door in bloodred pajamas and a black silk robe,2.9,3.0,3.2
6301,Sixty years ago in a similar situation I had broken my knuckles on someones face,2.5,3.5,3.2
6302,I merely said Is Tasha here,2.8,3.0,2.8
6303,Is Tasha here,2.9,3.1,3.1
6304,Now the Napulcans profit from their Hispanic siblings,2.9,3.2,3.0
6305,He pursed his lips slightly then nodded,3.0,2.9,3.1
6306,Yes,3.29,3.29,3.29
6307,May I see her,3.0,3.12,2.75
6308,When he hesitated I said Last night was my fault,2.5,3.12,3.13
6309,Last night was my fault,2.2,3.0,2.9
6310,I hold it against neither of you,3.0,3.0,2.92
6311,I,3.0,2.71,2.86
6312,Please,3.1,3.0,3.0
6313,He looked me and at last said Very well,3.33,2.83,3.0
6314,Very well,3.5,3.12,3.12
6315,We walked through his house in silence,2.9,2.7,2.9
6316,If that was Malaquezs work it was a very minor effort,2.8,3.0,3.1
6317,But then I was in no mood to consider art,2.63,2.75,3.0
6318,That was easier than despising myself,2.88,3.0,3.12
6319,I dont mean to sound cynical,2.57,3.14,3.29
6320,I should go in first,3.0,3.12,3.88
6321,What would it hurt,2.8,3.1,3.2
6322,True,3.33,3.0,3.44
6323,Go ahead,3.14,3.14,3.43
6324,Tell her,2.9,3.1,3.0
6325,I shrugged,2.8,2.8,2.9
6326,Tell her I love her,4.4,4.1,3.8
6327,I suppose I wish to show that Im still capable of a certain authorial distance a semblance of dispassionate observation,2.88,3.0,3.12
6328,He studied me then said Im sorry things happened this way Bernardo,2.7,3.0,2.7
6329,Im sorry things happened this way Bernardo,2.12,3.12,2.62
6330,Im very good at making things happen this way,3.38,3.13,3.62
6331,But if Tasha will forgive me,2.4,3.1,2.6
6332,He nodded repeated I am sorry then slipped into the next room,2.25,3.0,2.75
6333,I blinked when I opened the door,3.0,2.63,3.0
6334,Sunlight filled Malaquezs bedroom,3.37,2.88,3.0
6335,Tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed,2.9,3.6,2.8
6336,She was looking slightly to my left smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content,3.63,3.82,3.0
6337,Malaquez stood near her pointing something at my chest,3.0,2.89,3.0
6338,The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor,2.56,3.22,3.11
6339,Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have a gesture I would not make a poignant moment of repentence wonder despair or love,3.0,3.2,3.1
6340,The following events may indicate otherwise,3.0,3.0,3.2
6341,Had he been faster he could have had rage,2.8,3.4,3.3
6342,As he fell I scrambled onto him my knees pinning his arms my fingers probing his neck,2.44,3.56,3.67
6343,I shouted Where is she,2.82,4.0,3.54
6344,Where is she,3.0,3.0,3.11
6345,Tell me or Ill kill,2.4,3.6,3.8
6346,He began to cry,1.9,3.2,2.2
6347,She left,2.8,2.9,2.7
6348,Earlier this morning,3.0,2.67,3.0
6349,Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed,2.9,3.2,3.1
6350,I hit him with the back of my hand,2.6,3.5,3.6
6351,Tell me Malaquez,3.09,3.0,3.45
6352,She wanted to be famous,2.9,3.0,3.2
6353,He seemed to expect me to understand,2.86,2.86,3.14
6354,Where,3.2,4.0,3.2
6355,I demanded squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture,2.3,3.6,3.7
6356,I stared at the naked Tasha,3.25,3.25,3.12
6357,In fine tourist tradition most homes on Vega IV are named,3.0,2.9,3.0
6358,He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders people who would never be missed,3.0,2.8,2.8
6359,Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me and when someone came looking he would say we had gone islandhopping in our windboat,3.0,3.0,3.0
6360,Our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose,2.6,3.0,2.4
6361,Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo and its outer walls were coral pink,3.0,2.8,3.0
6362,His story would stand in either case,3.0,2.8,3.0
6363,I wanted him to tell me more but he babbled begging me to forgive him to understand,2.8,3.2,3.0
6364,I did not listen,2.33,3.17,3.5
6365,I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was art so we accepted it as art,2.88,3.0,3.25
6366,Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species,2.9,3.3,2.7
6367,But I was probably only looking at my reflection in the capturadors lens,3.0,2.89,3.0
6368,Had he said then that I should use it on myself I might have,2.86,3.0,3.14
6369,That moment passed,2.56,2.78,2.44
6370,I looked at Malaquez,3.1,2.9,3.0
6371,Were they moodsensitive they would have changed as I first viewed them,3.1,3.0,3.2
6372,His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound,2.8,2.8,2.6
6373,I turned to touch the cube that was Tashas crypt,2.4,3.1,2.8
6374,She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever and I could never know why,3.44,3.11,2.78
6375,I could free Tasha,3.1,3.1,3.8
6376,If I did one of three things would happen,3.1,3.0,3.2
6377,And the tiniest chance of all she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emils bedroom and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal,3.0,3.14,3.0
6378,The rental agent an attractive Napulcan named Tasha Cortez was not moodsensitive either,2.8,2.9,2.9
6379,As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tashas stopbox I heard Malaquez run for the door,3.0,2.8,3.1
6380,It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate,3.1,3.0,3.0
6381,Know this my future self Thanks to us Emil Malaquezs name will live as long as his masterpiece A SelfPortrait Anguish endures,3.4,2.9,3.5
6382,I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate,2.67,2.83,2.83
6383,But I can not stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death,2.2,3.3,2.5
6384,My fear is that she would live and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept admired and loved,2.6,3.6,2.7
6385,For in my way I have done the same thing,3.0,2.89,3.22
6386,I am ready for the mindwipe now,2.89,3.11,3.22
6387,Its beautiful isnt it Señor Flynn,3.5,3.2,2.9
6388,But she was young and attractive as I have said and may say again and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism,2.8,3.1,3.1
6389,And then because a playwright can not resist a promising line I said Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep,2.78,3.0,3.22
6390,Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep,2.44,3.11,3.56
6391,To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature,2.9,3.0,3.1
6392,Allow me my selfindulgences as you would those of a dying man when I convince my mindsmith to permit the wipe there will be another Bernardo Flynn one who knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here,2.88,3.0,3.25
6393,Her lower lip a trifle too narrow for her face perhaps her only physical flaw thrust forward slightly as she started to speak,3.29,3.29,3.43
6394,She caught herself slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place and said You dont like it,2.7,2.8,3.0
6395,You dont like it,2.7,3.2,3.0
6396,What could I do,2.62,2.75,2.38
6397,Like it,3.33,3.11,3.11
6398,I hate it despise it abhor it,1.3,4.4,3.5
6399,Its gaudy graceless pretentious That house is an affront to taste and intelligence,2.5,3.4,3.3
6400,I should buy it to raze it but I am not so kindhearted,2.5,3.2,3.5
6401,I might however rent it,3.0,3.1,3.1
6402,Captured Moments,3.4,3.1,3.2
6403,I think she only heard the last words of my speech,2.7,3.0,2.8
6404,Show me around and then I shall decide,3.0,2.8,3.2
6405,Of course Señor Flynn,3.12,2.88,2.38
6406,And stop calling me señor,2.43,3.29,3.86
6407,Not even Los Mundos is so polite,2.9,3.1,3.2
6408,If you wish,3.18,3.0,2.82
6409,I beg you change the color of the walls at the very least,2.67,2.89,3.0
6410,I stared,3.0,3.0,3.2
6411,Hows that,3.0,2.71,3.0
6412,I looked at her,3.0,3.2,3.2
6413,Worse,2.6,3.2,2.9
6414,I nodded,3.0,2.71,3.14
6415,I would not have thought it possible,3.11,2.56,3.0
6416,She frowned,2.43,3.0,3.14
6417,It is rather ugly,2.2,3.4,3.3
6418,Thoroughly ugly,2.29,3.43,3.14
6419,Thoroughly ugly I corrected with smile,3.0,3.2,3.1
6420,Obscenely ugly,1.4,2.9,3.2
6421,Obscenely ugly said she smiling too,3.87,2.87,3.12
6422,No,2.9,3.3,3.3
6423,I pointed,3.0,2.67,3.17
6424,It has no tower,2.82,2.55,3.09
6425,She reached for another dial on the house controls,3.0,2.75,3.12
6426,Dont you dare,2.5,4.1,4.0
6427,Her wrist when I grabbed it was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers,3.4,3.5,3.4
6428,Ill take it,3.75,3.75,3.88
6429,Exactly as it is,3.0,2.8,3.3
6430,God knows what you might do to it next,2.8,3.4,3.2
6431,Reluctantly I released her hand,2.4,3.4,2.7
6432,The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise,3.5,3.2,3.2
6433,Cloudwood had been used in a Mediterranean manner making the house seem primitive and civilized at the same time,3.14,3.0,3.0
6434,The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired,3.5,3.3,3.0
6435,From the living room the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha asked if I felt ill,3.0,3.7,2.9
6436,Im in love,4.37,4.12,3.5
6437,We both thought I referred to the vista,3.1,3.0,2.9
6438,Its strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one would remember and suddenly the forgotten in revenge rears up to savage the unwary,2.6,2.7,3.0
6439,My heart convulsed and I left this manuscript for a threeday spree,3.0,3.5,3.2
6440,And if I can brag and digress so easily this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe yes,2.7,3.0,3.1
6441,I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight,2.78,2.89,3.0
6442,My mindsmith is not so understanding,2.5,3.0,2.83
6443,Captured Moments,3.2,3.1,3.1
6444,She says I am emotionally a child to which I reply Of course,3.0,2.8,2.9
6445,Of course,3.2,3.0,3.2
6446,Why else would I come to you,2.75,2.88,3.12
6447,This logic does not soothe her she says I must wait three weeks,2.6,3.3,2.7
6448, ,3.0,2.8,3.0
6449,Such is the law,3.0,3.1,3.3
6450,I say I do not care about law I care about service and she should care about money,2.8,3.0,3.0
6451,Enough,2.3,3.4,3.5
6452,I went on a spree and it must have been a good one,3.67,3.44,3.33
6453,I dimly remember three bedpartners who were probably human and one that I hope was delirium,2.73,2.82,3.0
6454,I will not answer the phone for a week no matter whose face appears on it,2.63,3.12,3.5
6455,I keep evading the issue,2.6,3.1,2.6
6456,But which issue,2.9,3.0,2.9
6457,To deal with the first it hurts to remember,2.0,3.1,2.8
6458,If I am capable of love I loved Tasha Cortez,3.56,3.33,3.33
6459,If I am not I had the perfect mirror for my narcissism,2.9,3.3,3.4
6460,As for the issue itself Im no longer sure what I want to record,2.9,3.0,3.0
6461,The playwright in me wants every scene of our time together,3.5,3.1,3.4
6462,can’tmiss,3.0,3.0,3.2
6463,Wolves can run fast but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes,3.2,3.1,3.4
6464,Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska’s wolves from sameday airborne landandshoot slaughter,2.7,3.2,3.2
6465,Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves,3.0,3.43,3.29
6466,Soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow,3.0,2.7,2.9
6467,Defenders hopes to raise at least 100000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife a coalition of Alaska citizens win a citizens’ ballot initiative this November,3.0,3.0,3.2
6468,And we face very wealthy opponents,2.6,2.6,2.6
6469,This wolf will be running for its life,3.0,3.8,3.3
6470,Like you the majority of Alaskans oppose sameday landandshoot wolf killing,3.0,3.14,3.29
6471,But the antiwolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want,2.29,2.86,2.57
6472,And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game which opposed this legislation,2.6,3.6,3.2
6473,They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife and the rest of the American public,2.3,3.7,2.7
6474,The airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down,2.89,3.22,3.44
6475,In the name of wolf control wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion so that the wolves have literally no chance of survival,2.14,3.57,3.0
6476,wolf control,2.9,2.4,2.9
6477,Before the 1996 ban on sameday landandshoot as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice,2.4,3.4,3.0
6478,Antiwolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new landandshoot law stands even though most Alaskans do not support it,2.9,2.6,3.0
6479,Last Frontier,3.18,2.91,3.09
6480,Say NO to the barbaric practice of sameday airborne wolf killing,2.3,3.6,3.5
6481,NO,1.7,3.9,4.2
6482,The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on sameday airborne landandshoot wolf killing is with a Citizens’ Referendum,3.0,3.0,3.12
6483,You see the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a 15 trapping or 25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down,2.6,3.1,3.1
6484,Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves,3.0,3.0,3.25

6608,I too checked out a few listings for under 1000 and was absolutely shocked at the property taxes,2.7,3.7,2.8
6609,A 1000 house which could be fixed up into maybe a 3040000 house comes with a tax bill of 46K per year,2.8,3.8,2.9
6610,The taxes on my 140K house in an urban area of Mississippi are only 1500year,3.5,3.1,3.1
6611,And so Quiet Earp and I did some research and came up with a list of houses selling for under a grand,3.2,3.2,3.1
6612,We had plenty to choose from there were more cheap houses than we would have time to visit,3.7,3.4,3.1
6613,We picked two neighborhoods to cruise and dove in,3.3,3.2,3.3
6614,But once we entered Detroit the truth hit fast this is a modern American ghost town,2.7,3.2,3.2
6615,The place is practically deserted,2.6,3.0,3.0
6616,Its streets built wide to accommodate heavy traffic are mostly empty,2.9,3.0,3.0
6617,Houses and businesses are boarded up painted up bombed out and falling down,2.3,3.1,3.0
6618,I videotaped it,3.0,2.73,3.37
6619,It got worse as we drove into residential areas looking for those cheap houses,2.0,3.2,2.6
6620,Even in Chicagos South Side where we counted five white people in an hour I felt fine just driving around not so in Detroit,2.6,3.2,3.0
6621,Truthfully it wasnt about race it was about being naive,2.9,3.0,3.1
6622,It was about driving down streets where we truly did not belong and were not welcome,2.4,3.1,2.8
6623,The longtime center of American automotive manufacturing was gutted when the Big Three car companies simultaneously failed,2.7,2.9,3.0
6624,They live in deserted neighborhoods in houses with collapsed front steps and missing windows,2.8,3.3,3.0
6625,They sit on the porch and watch the cars go by watch the deals go down watch their neighborhoods crumble,2.3,3.2,2.5
6626,And we driving through slowly and reading house numbers in a latemodel Honda stuck out like a couple of thumbs,2.6,3.2,2.7
6627,So we sped up and went straight to the houses,2.91,3.36,2.91
6628,Sometimes we stopped to take a photo but mostly we didnt,2.9,2.9,3.0
6629,Earp and I have each lived happily in the wilds of West Oakland but the danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing Id experienced before,2.4,3.5,2.9
6630,I was actually afraid for my life,1.7,3.9,2.2
6631,The New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitchs 1900 home had already been stripped of its appliances and wiring,2.8,2.9,2.9
6632,But for Mitch that only added to its appeal because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with solar heating solar electricity and lowcost highefficiency appliances,3.6,3.3,3.3
6633,As for the 100 house,3.0,3.2,3.1
6634,It needed some work a hole patched some windows replaced,2.7,3.1,3.1

6636,Well I dont know what part of Detroit these folks live in but the 100 houses I saw looked more like this,2.9,3.2,3.0
6637,Detroit already plagued by corruption and crime saw its unemployment rate skyrocket in 2009,2.2,3.3,2.8
6638,You see abandoned houses in this town get set on fire,2.8,3.2,2.9
6639,No exceptions,2.64,2.91,3.45
6640,Wherever we went in those neighborhoods one in four houses had been torched,2.4,3.1,3.0

6665,Detroit A City to Yourself,2.9,3.1,3.0
6666,Its full of this imagery and talks about the 1805 fire and rebuilding and the postindustrial devastation thats ravaged the city since,2.9,3.0,3.0
6667,Most poignantly it talks about Hurricane Katrina which focused attention on rebuilding another city with this level of devastation and how without a single catastrophic event to blame for it Detroits decay has gone unsympathetically ignored,2.6,3.0,2.8
6668,About the pop fiction which explores the concept of a posthuman world and how it already exists now,3.1,3.1,3.1
6669,And about how if youre a pheasant thats not such a bad thing,3.1,2.9,3.0
6670,HOWEVER,2.8,3.1,3.0
6671,Theres a lot more to Detroit than that,3.0,3.2,3.3

6682,Some of that cheap real estate isnt too horrible either,3.2,3.4,3.1

6684,Some of the things theyve done down there are amazing and the community garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood,3.8,3.6,3.2
6685,Americas Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the Industrial Era and now lie well rusting as empty remainders of glory days past,2.7,3.1,3.1
6686,A few weeks ago someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools,2.0,3.2,2.5
6687,Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden,2.9,3.0,3.0
6688,Yes Detroits got more than its share of bad spots youre right,2.8,3.2,3.0
6689,Ive lived in the metro area my whole life and there are areas I cant call them neighborhoods down there where I dont feel safe in daytime much less at night,2.4,3.2,2.3
6690,But there are bright spots and behind every one of them is a person or a bunch of people who refuse to give up,3.4,3.2,3.1
6691,Jessica 19 Sep 2009 at 1030 am,3.0,2.7,3.0
6692,You are exactly the kind of person who gives me back the hope I lost on my way into town,3.8,3.5,3.0

6703,Even if it was a real fixerupper even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it thatd still be a hell of a deal,3.4,3.4,3.1
6704,2 Detroit proper has been dying for a long time before the 1968 riots even,2.6,3.0,3.1
6705,Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those pockets of innovation creativity and vision,3.0,3.1,2.9

6721,He started walking down the steps and around a corner,3.0,3.0,3.0
6722,It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner,2.67,3.78,3.0
6723,Im not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape but maybe perspective doesnt work quite the same there,3.0,2.67,2.83
6724,Glaring down at me from no more than twenty feet away was a grimacing thirty foot tall black face with staring blue and white eyes and it wore a ridiculous little hat,2.5,3.5,2.7
6725,He took a sip and closed his eyes like the cheap cup of coffee was really something special,3.3,3.1,3.0
6726,For some reason I thought of a giant clown face from a carnival ride but it scared the hell out me,2.1,3.7,2.4
6727,Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see,3.0,2.8,2.9
6728,It was a moai,3.0,2.8,3.0
6729,This is what I wanted to show you,3.2,3.4,3.4
6730,I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left,3.1,2.9,3.0
6731,I was pretty rattled but things fell together for me looking at the big statue the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground,2.75,3.25,2.5
6732,Acres nodded,3.2,2.9,3.2
6733,It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle,2.88,3.5,3.25
6734,So what does this have to do with gold,2.9,2.9,3.1
6735,You could step on that marker and make the gestures the device and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine,2.78,2.89,3.22
6736,You would end up on a small hill on Rapa Nui,3.0,2.8,2.8
6737,You could step three feet to the right and do the same thing and you would end up buried alive in a nearby rock face,2.7,3.2,3.1
6738,But I know how to make it take me anywhere,3.3,3.4,3.6
6739,It read Department of the Treasury Financial Management Service Status Report of US TreasuryOwned Gold,3.11,3.0,3.11
6740,I sucked in a whole lot of air,2.75,2.75,2.88
6741,Anywhere,3.17,3.0,2.83
6742,Anywhere he walked around the moai and came back wrestling with a big heavy bar of gold,3.2,3.5,3.0
6743,They only check deep storage once a year,3.0,2.5,3.1
6744,Otherwise the vault is sealed,3.1,2.8,3.1
6745,He set the cup down and looked straight at me for the first time,3.1,3.7,2.9
6746,Does anyone else know about this,3.1,3.3,3.1
6747,No they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew ready to stop me,2.91,3.0,3.09
6748,This is the 400 ounces which I mentioned at the restaurant,3.0,3.0,3.1
6749,About 150000 dollars at this mornings rate,2.91,3.18,2.91
6750,I looked at the sheet in my hand,3.0,2.89,3.0
6751,I had to read it twice,3.0,3.12,2.75
6752,I had never seen a dollar sign in front of that many number before,3.0,3.4,3.0
6753,The gold is still there,3.36,3.18,3.09
6754,How much can we sell before someone becomes suspicious,2.71,3.0,3.14
6755,Charles put the bar down and slid a web pouch over it with shoulder straps like a small backpack,2.8,3.1,3.1
6756,Call me small minded but you know a bird in the hand,3.0,2.8,3.1
6757,But I could handle a hundred and fiftyK easy say seventyfiveK from the fence,3.1,3.1,3.3
6758,Fine,2.8,2.9,2.8
6759,I waived down a waitress and ordered a cup of decaf and a slice of pie,3.0,2.57,3.57
6760,Then I made my way back to the little marker where we came in,3.0,3.1,3.2
6761,His mistake had been in telling me the same gesture opened the door the other way,2.89,3.0,3.0
6762,So the icy wind at the top of the mound and the bright moon came as a real relief,3.37,3.0,3.25
6763,The highway patrol was just bound to come by then,3.1,3.1,3.0
6764,After that it was just connect the dots back to prison,2.44,2.89,2.89
6765,The rental car records pointed to Acres and there was enough blood on the knife to match DNA from Acres comb in the motel,2.8,3.0,3.2
6766,They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into the country without a ticket on a plane or a boat,2.78,3.22,3.0
6767,I didnt like his tone much,2.2,2.7,3.2
6768,But they speculated all through the trial about where the gold came from offered me deals,3.1,3.1,3.2
6769,The prosecution liked the idea that Acres was my smugglers mule,2.9,2.7,2.8
6770,I was a one man gold cartel in the news,3.1,3.0,3.3
6771,So you sure youre not a cop Charles,3.0,2.89,3.0
6772,Im just wondering what theyll think when they open that vault in Kentucky,3.1,3.2,2.8
6773,Acres said it was dangerous but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even,2.8,3.3,3.1
6774,I figure it cant be worse than the lethal injection thats waiting for me at dawn,2.0,3.3,2.0
6775,I stared him down until he flinched,2.7,3.2,3.8
6776,I dont really believe Ill make it or I wouldnt say a thing,2.37,2.75,2.5
6777,Wish me luck,3.25,3.5,2.87
6778,I out of here,2.8,3.2,3.2
6779,As I did I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes,2.78,2.78,3.11
6780,m not a cop,2.9,3.0,3.0
6781,Charles might be for real but he was still going to get me in deep trouble,2.57,2.72,2.71
6782,Lets make real clear right now that you were joking buddy,2.7,3.3,3.5
6783,Otherwise this conversation is over,2.2,3.4,3.0
6784,Ive got a parole officer to explain things to and he wouldnt like that kinda talk,2.6,3.3,2.9
6785,Right,3.1,3.1,3.3
6786,Sorry,2.27,2.91,2.73
6787,Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile,2.7,2.8,2.8
6788,Like I was saying,2.9,3.1,3.2
6789,Im a researcher Ive come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for and I dont want to have to explain myself to anyone,2.88,3.25,3.62
6790,He said he had a business proposition for me,3.3,3.0,3.1
6791,The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone before going on Why me,2.45,3.18,2.73
6792,You were the first person who came to mind,3.1,3.1,3.1
6793,First person,3.0,3.0,3.0
6794,Twenty years out of high school,2.9,3.0,3.2
6795,How much of this valuable material are we talking about,3.0,3.0,3.12
6796,Four Hundred ounces for a start,3.14,3.14,3.0
6797,Four Hundred,3.0,2.9,3.0
6798,I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number,2.9,2.9,3.3
6799,Im staying in town,3.1,2.8,3.0
6800,Let me show you something,3.0,3.3,3.3
6801,I thought about it and made a quick call just telling a buddy that I was postponing our meeting for a couple of hours meaning he should come looking for me if I didnt show up,2.8,3.1,2.8
6802,He sounded surprised and said no he needed me to help him get rid of a large quantity of gold,3.25,3.63,3.37
6803,Charles might not look like much but I hadnt made it through my life taking that kind of chance,3.0,2.9,3.2
6804,I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock,3.1,3.2,3.3
6805,I had been an amateur magician for years,3.2,3.2,3.2
6806,One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air,3.4,3.4,3.3
6807,It never failed to amaze,4.0,3.25,3.38
6808,Sure,2.9,2.7,2.9
6809,Lets go I said,3.0,3.0,3.57
6810,There was only one chair so I sat on the edge of the bed as he handed me a book open to a picture of some sort of stone tablet,2.9,2.3,2.8
6811,Rapa Nui he said Easter Island,3.0,2.88,3.0
6812,This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as rongorongo,3.1,3.1,3.1
6813,For a long time no one was able to decipher it although by deduction Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four,3.11,2.78,3.11
6814,I told him Id meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven,3.14,3.0,3.57
6815,But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the Birdman statuette,2.8,2.9,2.9
6816,And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more,2.5,3.0,3.0
6817,He flipped pages to another image But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai,3.1,2.8,3.2
6818,See here how they form a pattern very similar to this,2.9,2.9,3.1
6819,There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldnt read from where I sat,2.9,2.8,2.8
6820,he was already there sitting in a booth warming his hands on a cup of coffee,3.0,2.63,2.75
6821,This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds,3.1,3.0,3.0
6822,He closed the little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction,3.89,3.44,3.33
6823,I want to show you that mound,3.1,2.9,3.2
6824,You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history archeology and then linguistics,3.33,3.22,3.11
6825,And this mound is where you found gold,3.1,3.2,3.1
6826,Was this some crazy treasure hunt,2.5,3.1,2.9
6827,Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me,2.0,3.7,2.6
6828,No its more complicated than that but I need to show you the mound for you to understand,2.63,3.12,3.25
6829,He looked like jerked meat on the bone,2.8,2.9,2.8
6830,The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up,3.1,3.4,3.0
6831,He was smiling now and his eyes werent so tired,3.6,3.3,2.8
6832,I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make so I said yes but my patience was running out,2.4,2.9,2.6
6833,Charles Acres called me on a Thursday afternoon just like that,3.2,2.9,3.1
6834,It was dark as we left,3.0,3.0,2.89
6835,When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow,2.8,2.8,2.9
6836,A low black hill blocked the sky right in front of us,2.8,2.9,2.9
6837,We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like it was right here,2.8,3.0,3.0
6838,My patience was long gone and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for,2.7,3.0,2.9
6839,We trudged back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it,2.86,2.86,3.0
6840,It looked like a bamboo walking stick,3.0,2.7,3.0
6841,This is it he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground,3.0,3.0,3.29
6842,See how the lines form the pattern in the journal the same one as the moai,3.0,3.2,3.1
6843,So you drew this I asked vaguely slow to catch on,2.67,2.89,2.56
6844,So you drew this,3.0,2.9,2.9
6845,He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger,2.14,3.29,2.71
6846,Its stone,3.1,3.0,3.2
6847,Ancient,3.1,2.9,3.1
6848,For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear making me glad I was in a suit,3.2,3.1,3.3
6849,Here stand beside me he said,3.1,2.9,3.1
6850,Im not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device,3.0,2.75,3.12
6851,I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck,2.8,3.4,2.7
6852,OK watch and remember this,3.14,3.14,3.43
6853,Im going to do it in two parts last part first so it wont take effect,3.0,3.0,3.1
6854,Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort,2.6,3.1,2.9
6855,I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo they arent all writing language,3.0,3.0,3.2
6856,Some are just a memory device,3.1,2.8,3.2
6857,Mnemonic,3.0,2.7,3.0
6858,Yes,3.2,3.2,3.3
6859,Theres a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language,3.3,3.1,3.0
6860,He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight,3.6,3.2,2.9
6861,His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses,2.9,2.7,3.0
6862,I didnt have much trouble duplicating his hand waving even though I hadnt paid much attention,3.11,2.89,3.0
6863,I even swapped the two parts as he had asked,2.9,3.1,2.7
6864,I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped but he shouted No just before everything changed,2.5,3.6,2.8
6865,I was standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone,3.1,3.1,3.2
6866,For as far as I could see by a weak gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms,3.11,2.56,2.89
6867,I seemed to be somewhere in the middle there was as much above as below,3.1,2.8,2.9
6868,The sky was dull and featureless and overcast,2.3,2.5,2.9
6869,So the mining business is treating you pretty good huh Charles,3.25,2.88,3.25
6870,The air smelled bad in some way I cant describe and at my feet I could see the same design from the little journal and the mound carved into the rock,2.38,3.0,3.0
6871,I was in shock,2.2,3.5,2.8

6886,Both my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind even though I was a fast cane walker I envied their freedom and most of all the incredible bond they both had with their guide dogs With my Lab Jay I feel so wonderfully FREE,3.7,3.8,3.3

6911,Me I found a space suit but it was statistically unlikely that I and whomever else has followed suit pun intended would manage to repair our ship before the lessthantwentyfour hours are up yes studies have been done,2.8,3.3,3.1
6912,I could have started asking questions but I wanted to get my bearings first,2.88,2.88,3.5
6913,Tonight was for observation,3.12,2.88,3.0
6914,I didnt bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people though,3.0,2.9,3.1
6915,They all looked the same clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt the hangerson the circle with whom the gossip was shared,2.86,3.0,3.0
6916,I wondered at the ship instead,3.0,2.73,2.91
6917,All the fine food and the ornamental lighting it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain,3.0,3.0,3.11
6918,If the barkeep was any indication I suspected similarly highclass robots fulfilled other positions on the ship,3.0,2.9,2.7
6919,How they were all powered was a mysteryas good as the technology got a quality robot like that was still an energy sink,2.9,3.0,2.9
6920,It was the brain mostly the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources,2.9,2.9,3.0
6921,Sarahs crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at,3.0,2.7,2.8
6922,By the end of the evening when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room a satisfying haze had settled on my mind,3.5,2.9,3.0
6923,It was nice I decided,3.88,3.38,3.5
6924,This ship,3.0,2.7,2.9
6925,This life,3.0,2.88,3.0
6926,Did it truly matter what the ships origin was and why Jefferson had saved me if now I was content,3.0,2.9,2.9
6927,Fact Its easy to fall into patterns,2.88,3.0,3.0
6928,I would wake late checking the clock on my rooms lightscreen to make sure I hadnt slept through brunch,2.9,2.9,2.8
6929,I would watch old films on the entertainment screens taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions,3.0,2.7,3.5
6930,I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks,3.12,3.13,3.12
6931,I would attend afternoon dance classes so that when the evening dances came around modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior I would be less of an embarrassment to myself,2.8,3.1,2.9
6932,So twentyfour hours,3.0,2.6,3.0
6933,I told myself I should,3.1,3.1,3.1
6934,I told myself that tonight the observation period would end and Id start puzzling out the ships mystery,3.0,2.9,3.4
6935,Give or take,3.0,2.9,3.0
6936,About the time I was composing my last words in my head trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like thats when I heard a bell,2.6,3.5,2.8
6937,I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earththis was my longawaited vacation my clean break and my temporary retreat Id try contacting those friends tomorrow,3.22,3.0,3.11
6938,I continued to care little for shipwide gossip but our discussions of films and flicks old and new brought out my artistic storyloving argumentative side a side of me Id tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer,3.5,3.2,3.2
6939,It was a good life if surreal,3.2,3.2,3.1
6940,But I wasnt sure I wanted the dream stage to end,3.0,2.86,3.0
6941,Fact Some places are timeless,3.2,3.2,3.2
6942,Days passed weeks passed but I couldnt tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued,2.73,2.91,3.09
6943,All there was all I remembered was a blur,2.7,3.1,2.6
6944,Gathering for drinks in the parlors playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets some of it modern some of it period dress for special themed events idling in the lounges,3.0,2.9,3.1
6945,Now and then a new face mingled in the crowd,3.1,2.9,3.1
6946,Other faces washed out fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines,2.71,2.86,2.86
6947,So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didnt keep the air in I heard nothing,2.43,3.14,2.86
6948,One of these evenings we were gathered in the South Ballroom for postdinner drinks lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor,3.4,3.3,3.2
6949,South,3.0,2.5,3.13
6950,There werent,2.9,3.1,3.2
6951,My first thought I was going crazy,2.3,3.5,2.5
6952,Maybe it was her curiosity asking a question I should have asked long before that turned the conversation serious maybe there was just something special about that evening,3.2,3.1,3.1
6953,Twentyfour hours of silence vacuum remember was I hallucinating noises now,2.87,3.0,3.13
6954,Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life hitting some threshold or some breaking point,2.5,2.7,2.7
6955,Regardless when Adrienne asked what the ships purpose was we all gave it a measure of thought,3.0,2.8,3.1
6956,We dredged up halffledged theories and inchoate explanations tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films,2.8,2.9,3.2
6957,I believe well see the end of the universe,2.78,3.11,3.0
6958,I believe well see the end of the universe said Tiffany,2.8,2.9,2.7
6959,Captains cohort she had a glass of orangebrown liquid in one hand it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor,3.0,2.89,3.11
6960,She swirled it speculatively,3.1,3.3,3.1
6961,I watched Adrienne,3.12,2.75,3.5
6962,Impossible,2.6,3.1,2.8
6963,Impossible said Zheng sitting in the chair to her left,3.0,2.9,3.2
6964,Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,2.5,3.0,2.88
6965,He didnt drink but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques,3.0,2.88,3.12
6966,Maybe well travel at the speed of light and we wont age,3.11,3.0,3.0
6967,Maybe well travel at the speed of light and we wont age said Sarah setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch,3.2,2.7,3.0
6968,Maybe were already traveling at the speed of light,3.5,3.25,3.12
6969,Relatively says it all,3.0,3.25,3.25
6970,Zheng scoffed,2.7,3.3,3.2
6971,Also impossible,2.5,3.1,2.7
6972,Also impossible Even if we were traveling at ninetynine percent of the speed of lightthats assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible because it isntwed still age Wed just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us,2.8,3.5,2.8
6973,And,3.0,3.0,3.0
6974,said Sarah,2.9,2.5,3.0
6975,Aging is relative anyway,3.1,2.4,3.0
6976,Aging is relative anyway Besides I wouldnt mind being around forever Give our ancestors purpose Keep their dreams alive,3.2,3.1,3.3
6977,Besides I wouldnt mind being around forever,3.4,3.2,3.2
6978,New hypothesis,3.25,3.13,3.0
6979,No ones immortal In fact the opposite Were all going to die,2.4,3.1,2.9
6980,In fact the opposite Were all going to die,1.9,3.4,2.9
6981,Bleak,2.11,2.78,2.56
6982,Bleak commented Zheng,2.73,2.63,2.91
6983,But I like it,3.9,3.0,3.1
6984,Were all going to die so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have,2.9,3.5,3.3
6985,Kishori gestured to the bar the carpets the paintings,3.0,2.75,3.0
6986,All the luxuries money can buy,3.22,3.22,3.22
6987,All the luxuries money can buy,3.9,3.5,3.5
6988,All the luxuries money can buy she echoed,3.44,3.44,3.44
6989,And accompanying the bell I saw a light,3.1,3.1,3.0
6990,Paid for how,2.75,2.88,3.0
6991,Smuggling,2.62,2.75,2.88
6992,Matteroffact,3.12,2.88,3.12
6993,Jefferson snorted amused,3.6,3.1,3.1
6994,Think about it Kishori continued where else would we get the money to buy all this,3.0,2.89,3.0
6995,where else would we get the money to buy all this,3.1,3.1,2.9
6996,Renegade smugglers,2.25,3.12,3.12
6997,Renegade smugglers So whats our cargo eh captain,2.78,3.45,3.11
6998,So whats our cargo eh captain,3.0,3.0,3.0
6999,Zheng joked leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine,3.3,2.8,3.1
7000,Jefferson shook his head and stood up,2.9,2.9,3.1
7001,Ill leave you to your speculation,3.0,3.0,3.14
7002,Ill leave you to your speculation he said,2.9,2.9,3.1
7003,Now there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense,2.63,3.25,2.88
7004,A chorus of good nights followed him out the door,3.3,3.3,3.2
7005,After the captain left Zheng leaned in,3.0,3.0,3.0
7006,He set his glass down on an end table steepled his fingers together,2.8,3.0,3.0
7007,Were revolting he told us,2.6,3.2,3.3
7008,And I dont mean that you disgust me,2.45,3.36,2.91
7009,And I dont mean that you disgust me No were the start of a rebellion Did you hear what the captain said earlier He means were going to change the future The universe as we know it wont be the same,3.13,3.75,3.88
7010,No were the start of a rebellion,2.9,3.2,3.4
7011,The universe as we know it wont be the same,2.6,3.3,2.7
7012,Wouldnt we know it if we were part of a rebellion,3.0,3.0,2.9
7013,Zheng shook his head,2.86,2.71,2.71
7014,The captain selected us for a reason He has inside intelligencehow else would he know where to find us He knows about us,3.1,3.1,2.8
7015,He has inside intelligencehow else would he know where to find us,3.1,3.1,2.9
7016,He knows about us,2.89,3.11,2.78
7017,Thats still dumb,2.0,3.75,3.37
7018,Thats still dumb said Sarah,2.2,3.2,2.8
7019,Inside intelligence,3.11,3.11,3.33
7020,Inside intelligence Dont you remember theres not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information,3.0,2.9,2.8
7021,Dont you remember theres not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information,3.0,3.2,2.9
7022,First the whole inavacuum whysthereabell thing,3.0,2.88,3.0
7023,Jefferson didnt share how he found people,2.6,3.0,2.8
7024,He didnt share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were or why he saved some people but not others,2.88,3.0,2.88
7025,But then again no one asked,3.0,2.9,2.9
7026,He had been at this savior business longer than any of us,3.0,2.8,3.0
7027,I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that,2.9,3.1,2.7
7028,Were going to mean something,3.38,3.37,3.5
7029,Were going to mean something Zheng was saying,3.33,2.83,3.5
7030,What we do rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us were going to leave a legacy,3.3,3.4,3.5
7031,He sounded certain,3.11,3.11,3.56
7032,Enthusiastic even,3.6,3.3,3.2
7033,Ray he shook his head and broke the quiet hed held most of the evening,2.82,3.09,2.82
7034,Youve got it all wrong,2.3,3.5,3.6
7035,He looked from Sarah to Adrienne to Zheng to Kishori and Tiffany to me,2.9,3.0,3.1
7036,Obviously we cant last longer than the rest of the universe,2.7,2.9,3.2
7037,All were doing is existing,3.0,3.1,3.1
7038,We arent special,2.62,3.0,2.75
7039,Again bleak,2.2,3.4,2.7
7040,Again bleak commented Zheng,2.6,3.1,3.0
7041,Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet,2.7,3.2,2.6
7042,She leaned forward setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her,3.0,2.88,2.88
7043,You never know when it will end,2.89,2.89,2.89
7044,You cant hold on forever even if you dont ever ever want to forget,2.57,3.14,3.43
7045,How long until the memories slip away,2.4,3.0,2.4
7046,How long until all you remember is this the ship the thick red carpeting the chandeliers the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people,2.6,2.9,2.9
7047,I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship,3.1,3.1,3.0
7048,I wondered why if he had such an unpropitious outlook he hadnt tried to change his situation,2.62,3.12,2.75
7049,I wanted to ask but he was still talking and I was too selfconscious to interrupt,2.9,3.2,2.4
7050,You can try to hold on,2.8,3.3,3.1
7051,You can try to hold on said Ray,2.7,3.3,2.7
7052,You can try and try and try,2.9,3.0,3.3
7053,Repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night sketch faces in your mind,3.0,3.1,3.1
7054,But words if you repeat them enough times lose their meaning,2.7,2.7,2.9
7055,My wifes name once,2.88,2.75,3.12
7056,Repeat it enough times its just a sound,2.8,2.8,3.0
7057,These signals were the heralds of my saviors,3.3,3.2,3.2
7058,No longer grounded,3.75,3.25,3.62
7059,Ray he said If we last forever if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out it wont mean a thing to us,3.1,3.1,2.8
7060,If we last forever if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out it wont mean a thing to us We wont care that were last and we wont care that there are no more stars We arent angels Were just dumb and lucky,3.1,2.7,3.1
7061,Pure dumb luck,2.7,3.2,2.9
7062,Pure dumb luck he said,3.0,3.3,2.8
7063,Struck a nerve huh,2.7,3.2,3.1
7064,said Zheng,2.88,2.75,3.12
7065,Sorry,2.43,2.86,2.86
7066,Sorry said Ray,2.7,2.9,2.9
7067,How long ago was that,3.0,2.62,2.75
7068,asked Adrienne,3.0,2.38,3.0
7069,Leaving your wife I mean,2.56,3.11,2.89
7070,Leaving your wife I mean Traveling on this ship,2.89,2.67,2.78
7071,The first words they said to me meant nothing,2.7,2.9,2.9
7072,I dont know,2.5,3.1,2.8
7073,I dont know he said,2.86,2.71,3.0
7074,We were all quiet for a moment,2.73,2.55,2.55
7075,We let him go,3.2,2.8,3.4
7076,Silent,2.9,2.2,2.9
7077,Selfconscious,2.6,2.6,2.4
7078,More excuses were made and after a few moments only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom,2.72,3.28,2.86
7079,She looked across the circle of couches at me,3.0,3.12,3.0
7080,she asked me,3.1,3.1,3.1
7081,I shrugged,2.5,3.0,2.9
7082,How long have you been here,3.0,2.9,3.0
7083,I wasnt listening I didnt care I was going to live I was going to keep breathing,3.2,3.2,3.3
7084,Not that long,3.0,3.12,3.12
7085,Not that long I said,3.0,3.1,3.1
7086,A couple weeks I guess Maybe a month or two,3.0,2.9,2.9
7087,Why dont you know for sure,2.67,3.22,3.0
7088,she asked,3.0,2.88,2.88
7089,I shrugged,2.9,3.0,3.0
7090,I hadnt been counting days,2.9,2.9,2.9
7091,What did you do before this,3.0,2.9,3.0
7092,What did you do before this How were you found,3.0,3.0,3.2
7093,How were you found,3.2,3.3,3.2
7094,I was an engineer,3.09,2.73,3.09
7095,I explained how my ship had malfunctioned no warning at all,2.88,3.0,3.0
7096,The explosions the impossible rescue,2.7,3.2,2.8
7097,She nodded,3.14,2.86,3.0
7098,The ship I was on I guess thats what happened too,3.0,3.0,3.25
7099,The ship I was on I guess thats what happened too Some vital part broke and well boom It was all so fast,2.8,3.3,2.7
7100,Some vital part broke and,2.3,3.3,2.5
7101,well boom,2.9,3.0,3.2
7102,It was all so fast,3.0,3.37,2.75
7103,Im going to figure it out,3.11,3.0,3.44
7104,How and why this ship exists,2.9,3.0,3.0
7105,How and why this ship exists Ill figure it out then Im going to find a way home,3.0,3.1,3.4
7106,I paced my room that night unable to sleep,2.1,3.4,2.6
7107,Next to those nothing else mattered,2.82,2.82,3.09
7108,Worse Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question,2.7,3.0,2.7
7109,Fact Adrienne intimidated me,2.0,3.67,2.22
7110,Fact Its too easy to fall into patterns,2.9,2.7,2.8
7111,I resolved to break the pattern,3.14,3.0,3.29
7112,Another evening another chandeliered room another swirl of conversations and dances and hor doevres,3.3,3.3,3.1
7113,Has anyone ever left,3.0,3.0,3.0
7114,Adrienne looked at each of us in turn,3.0,3.27,2.82
7115,Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng,3.0,3.0,3.1
7116,Sarah frowned,2.6,3.0,3.0
7117,Now that you mention it I havent seen Alexis in days,2.3,2.8,2.7
7118,Now that you mention it I havent seen Alexis in days I assumed he was indisposed,2.75,3.0,2.75
7119,I assumed he was indisposed,2.88,2.75,3.0
7120,Kishori nodded in agreement,3.18,2.73,2.82
7121,After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away there was lightning but no thunder,2.9,3.2,2.8
7122,I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow,2.9,3.1,3.2
7123,What,2.88,3.13,3.12
7124,Well,3.0,3.12,3.0
7125,Well Ray said slowly People do leave,2.6,2.9,2.9
7126,People do leave The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same But we see new faces,2.82,2.82,2.63
7127,The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same,3.0,2.67,3.0
7128,Fact Sound is a vibration,2.9,2.9,3.2
7129,Youre sure its not just some people being indisposed,2.8,2.8,2.9
7130,asked Adrienne using Sarahs phrasing,3.0,2.6,2.9
7131,Keep adding people long enough regardless you get more overall,2.86,2.71,3.43
7132,A couple people staying in their rooms even if you switch out the people wont make a difference,2.8,2.9,3.0
7133,He dropped the pecans back into the dish one by one,3.0,2.6,2.8
7134,So where do they go,3.0,2.8,2.9
7135,Adrienne focused on Zheng,2.88,2.75,3.0
7136,I cut in,2.86,3.0,3.57
7137,Maybe a better question is does anyone ever come back,3.0,3.0,2.71
7138,Kishori chewed her lip,3.0,3.17,3.0
7139,Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink,2.8,2.9,2.9
7140,After a moment Ray said I dont think so,2.75,3.0,2.88
7141,Are there patterns,3.0,3.14,3.14
7142,Adrienne asked,3.0,2.55,2.91
7143,Who leaves,2.9,3.1,2.8
7144,Again there was an uncomfortable moment of silence,2.36,2.91,2.64
7145,I hazarded a guess,3.0,3.0,3.0
7146,You dont notice do you,2.8,3.2,3.2
7147,Of course we notice,3.0,3.4,3.3
7148,But well no one important ever disappears so it doesnt really matter does it,3.0,2.9,3.1
7149,I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left and failing,2.6,3.0,2.8
7150,No one offered a different answer,3.0,2.9,3.0
7151,I looked at Adrienne,3.0,2.88,2.88
7152,Mission accomplished Our routine insouciance had been disrupted,3.43,3.43,3.71
7153,I reserved the right to revise this opinion later,3.0,2.7,3.3
7154,How long have you been here,2.9,2.7,2.9
7155,The question previously posed to me was presented to the rest of our group excluding Ray Adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill recalling the last time the subject was broached,2.75,3.12,2.88
7156,Sarah she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass,3.12,2.88,2.88
7157,A long time,3.0,3.0,2.9
7158,Got to be months and months at least,3.0,2.44,3.11
7159,You were here before I was,3.0,2.9,3.5
7160,You were here before I was said Kishori and so was Tiffany,3.1,3.1,3.4
7161,When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue I looked around,2.7,3.5,2.8
7162,I looked at Zheng he shrugged,2.9,2.8,3.0
7163,Time passes in a weird way here,3.0,2.6,3.0
7164,Time passes in a weird way here I kept track for a whilethirtyeight daysbut after that I guess I didnt see the point,2.8,3.0,3.0
7165,I kept track for a whilethirtyeight daysbut after that,2.9,3.0,3.0
7166,I guess I didnt see the point,2.6,2.9,3.1
7167,Fact Some places are timeless,3.1,3.3,3.0
7168,asked Adrienne,3.0,2.9,3.1
7169,Days dont matter,3.0,2.9,3.0
7170,Days dont matter he said,2.4,2.9,3.0
7171,Tiffany nodded but Kishori spoke before the other woman could,2.89,3.0,3.44
7172,she asked Adrienne,3.0,2.7,3.0
7173,Adrienne met her gaze,3.12,2.87,3.12
7174,But were not here forever,3.0,3.0,3.0
7175,But were not here forever objected Sarah,2.87,3.0,3.12
7176,Remember,3.1,3.0,2.9
7177,Disappeared I corrected her,2.9,2.9,3.2
7178,We dont know how or why he left,2.3,2.9,2.6
7179,We dont know how or why he left Or where he went,2.7,3.0,3.0
7180,Or where he went,3.0,2.78,3.0
7181,Zheng looked thoughtful,3.14,2.86,3.0
7182,The ship it was odd and old either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldnt tell what make it was and somehow the crew standing around me fit the same description a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk,2.78,2.89,2.78
7183,He picked up his glass swirled the liquid around took a sip then set the glass back down,3.0,2.9,3.0
7184,He glanced around at the rest of us,2.9,3.3,2.9
7185,Do you want to leave,3.0,3.2,3.3
7186,Could you live anywhere else now,2.8,3.2,3.2
7187,I spoke up,3.22,3.22,3.78
7188,Yes,3.3,3.0,3.1
7189,Yes I said,3.29,3.14,3.14
7190,I wouldnt miss this much,2.8,3.3,3.0
7191,No one else said anything,2.82,2.55,3.09
7192,I watched Adriennes eyes move from one face to the next,2.8,3.2,2.7
7193,Zheng he addressed me again leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense steady gaze,2.9,3.1,2.9
7194,You think that,3.0,3.0,3.0
7195,You think that he said but is it true,3.0,3.0,3.2
7196,but is it true Would you be happy back in a normal life working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days,2.67,3.11,3.22
7197,Fact Its too easy to fall into patterns,2.86,2.86,2.71
7198,Fact I wasnt sure I wanted the dream stage to end,3.0,2.78,3.22
7199,My quarters felt stifling,2.22,3.11,2.78
7200,Asphyxiating my mind,2.6,3.2,3.0
7201,I sat sideways in the armchair feet dangling over one arm neck resting against the other absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation,2.9,3.1,3.0
7202,There was a schedule advertising upcoming onship events such as dance classes craft sessions and discussion groups and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to,3.1,2.9,3.1
7203,A menu of display options allowing me to customize all the lightscreens superficial characteristics,2.9,2.5,3.1
7204,A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship,2.9,2.5,3.3
7205,That was all,3.0,2.9,3.0
7206,A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms the ample closet space and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder,2.7,2.8,3.1
7207,I was discouraged and frustrated,2.2,3.6,2.6
7208,I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ships mystery just as much as she did,3.12,3.5,3.5
7209,I wanted to find something anything that would prove all this was normal and sane,2.86,3.14,3.43
7210,And me I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle,2.8,3.0,2.6
7211,I didnt want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences,2.67,2.67,3.33
7212,In one hand I balanced my plate of starshaped crackers globs of elegant dips and garnishes little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant and an array of other delectable bitesized items,3.4,3.1,3.3
7213,My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a small table against a wall,3.1,3.1,3.4
7214,She glared at me but obediently let me pull her along,3.0,3.18,3.09
7215,Tell me,2.8,3.1,3.5
7216,I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest one more stranded survivor who was found,2.63,3.12,2.63
7217,what you have found,3.0,3.1,3.2
7218,She gave me a grumpy look that informed me quite clearly of her current opinion of me,2.25,3.25,3.0
7219,Not if youre going to be rude about it,1.9,3.6,3.3
7220,I sighed,2.2,2.7,2.2
7221,Sorry,2.3,3.1,2.6
7222,I wasnt not really but Id lie to get the conversation going,3.12,3.0,3.25
7223,I explained in two brief sentences my earlier impasse,3.0,2.9,3.2
7224,I dont know much,2.6,2.8,2.7
7225,I heard the captain say something yesterday as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side talking to a couple people and they must not have known I was there He said something about a wreck going well And listen when they came round the corner Ray was with the captain,2.9,3.1,2.9
7226,I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side talking to a couple people and they must not have known I was there,2.8,3.0,3.0
7227,He said something about a wreck going well,3.0,3.1,3.1
7228,The next time the captain stopped by our group Tiffany tagging along pretending that she too was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone we were ready,3.0,3.1,3.1
7229,I was now one of them,3.12,3.12,3.0
7230,Is there a doctor on board,2.8,3.5,3.1

7238,Medical AI were even more expensive than the barkeep,2.5,2.88,2.88
7239,I wondered how many people it treated,3.12,3.12,3.0
7240,Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill,2.9,2.9,2.8
7241,Does he age,3.0,3.0,3.0

7243,The captain,3.0,3.2,3.0
7244,I never thought about it,3.0,2.09,3.0
7245,Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face,3.0,2.83,2.83
7246,That doesnt answer my question,2.38,3.5,2.75
7247,Adrienne only picked at her food,2.56,2.89,3.0
7248,Not hungry,3.0,2.89,3.11
7249,No,2.2,3.0,3.4
7250,No said Adrienne,2.25,3.5,3.5
7251,At least have a drink said Sarah,3.0,3.1,3.2
7252,said Kishori,3.0,2.8,3.0
7253,Maybe thats the problem,2.6,3.4,3.0
7254,Maybe thats the problem said Sarah,2.75,2.88,3.25
7255,One hundred and fortyseven is a magic number,3.2,3.3,3.0
7256,One hundred and fortyseven is a magic number said Sarah,3.1,3.0,2.9
7257,Well weve got the perfectsize group right here,3.38,3.0,3.25
7258,Just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other,2.6,3.0,3.0
7259,Why doesnt anyone mutiny,2.8,3.1,3.0
7260,Adrienne asked,3.09,2.82,3.18
7261,We cant,2.3,3.1,2.8
7262,Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust,1.62,3.5,2.63
7263,You could force the captain to set down somewhere,2.75,3.37,3.5
7264,You could force the captain to set down somewhere Let us off the ship If he refuses threaten him If he still refuses well of all of us isnt there someone who can drive a ship,2.3,3.6,3.4
7265,Let us off the ship,2.9,3.2,3.2
7266,If he still refuses well of all of us isnt there someone who can drive a ship,2.9,3.1,3.2
7267,Floating alone each of us facing the silence of the vacuum we were found,3.0,3.0,3.0
7268,Thats murder,2.1,3.6,3.1
7269,Thats murder objected Sarah,2.3,3.5,3.0
7270,Thats survival,3.0,2.5,3.4
7271,Thats survival Adrienne corrected her,2.88,3.5,2.88
7272,Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life,2.1,3.6,3.5
7273,I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge looking out the windows at the stars,3.5,2.8,3.0
7274,Times like that running on less sleep than I should alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it,3.0,2.56,2.78
7275,The stillness of the room contributed as did the view,3.0,2.89,3.11
7276,All of it was temporary save for the black,2.8,2.7,2.8
7277,Once found we can never be lost,3.4,3.0,3.2
7278,Everything to fade away lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born,2.6,3.1,2.7
7279,Eyes bulging in panic but no screams,2.5,3.5,2.75
7280,Some things in this world we have to make them permanent ourselves,2.91,3.09,3.27
7281,He had made us a constant,3.0,2.75,3.0
7282,He made this shipthis lifea constant,3.11,3.11,3.11
7283,The one thing that was known,3.0,2.63,2.91
7284,The one thing that wouldnt change,2.9,2.8,3.0
7285,Maybe everything we did all the stories we told maybe it was all lies,2.5,3.2,2.9
7286,We can never leave,2.38,3.0,2.75
7287,But ultimately this ship its purpose our purposedid it matter,2.91,2.82,3.09
7288,We each had our own theory,3.13,3.0,3.38
7289,Maybe that was enough,2.9,3.2,2.9
7290,So Im on a ship now,3.0,3.33,3.0
7291,So Im on a ship now You do this a lot,3.0,3.0,3.0
7292,Maybe that made us more real,3.2,2.8,2.8
7293,Maybe it made us feel less alone,2.89,2.78,2.89
7294,Mind if I join you,3.1,3.1,2.8
7295,I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway,3.1,3.0,3.1
7296,She smiled then crossed the room to join me by the window not waiting for an answer,3.67,3.22,3.22
7297,You do this a lot,3.0,3.2,3.0
7298,I cant see the meaning in any of it All these things I do theyre just to pass the time until I die,2.12,3.13,2.5
7299,All these things I do theyre just to pass the time until I die,2.38,2.88,2.75
7300,You dont see a meaning because there is no meaning she said,3.0,3.1,3.0
7301,A woman introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful shrugged,2.8,2.8,3.2
7302,After all of it as much as we feared being alone we feared being vulnerable even more,2.6,3.0,2.5
7303,Our instinct was to hide,2.8,3.1,2.8
7304,Look what I found,3.44,3.33,3.11
7305,Look what I found Adrienne said,3.3,3.6,3.0

7313,I didnt want to forget,2.7,3.0,3.3
7314,The last thing I remember I was tearing down the corridors,2.7,3.4,3.0
7315,Now and then,3.0,3.0,3.0
7316,Every ship had life boats,3.0,2.9,2.9
7317,In case of emergency break glass,3.0,3.0,3.1

7322,Failing all else Id suffocate,1.75,3.37,2.0
7323,Alone,2.4,3.1,2.6
7324,Ray he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls finding no glass to break,2.8,3.4,3.0
7325,Relax,3.37,2.82,3.09
7326,Why didnt you save them,2.75,3.12,2.63
7327,Itll pass he told me,3.13,3.25,3.0
7328,He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing,3.0,3.57,3.0
7329,I can never leave,2.45,3.27,2.27
7330,As much as Jesse had irritated me I didnt like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave body swollen and bloated,2.2,3.4,3.0
7331,Who would tell his girl how he had died,2.37,3.25,3.0
7332,Couldnt said the captain,2.7,2.9,3.0

7337,You fit the bill,3.3,2.8,3.2
7338,You fit the bill They didnt,3.2,3.3,3.2
7339,Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that allexpensespaid vacationfortwo she won last time he was on leave,3.0,2.89,3.11
7340,They didnt,2.67,3.0,2.89
7341,Tiffany she looked at the captain grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder,3.33,3.22,3.22
7342,She turned to me,3.0,3.0,3.0
7343,Come on,2.89,3.22,3.22

7347,No time for questions,2.63,2.88,3.75
7348,No time for answers,2.86,3.0,3.14
7349,The ship had all the usual accoutrements artificial gravity tastefully painted walls sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane recycled air systems and a few lessusual lush carpeting lighting that was decorative as well as functional spacious corridors,3.29,2.43,3.29
7350,Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways music voices the aroma of real food,3.4,3.3,3.1
7351,This was heaven,3.8,3.2,2.8
7352,No seventytwo virgins but it would do,3.0,3.2,3.0
7353,Tiffany looked back,3.0,2.9,3.0

7364,Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and in space there is no medium,3.0,2.5,3.2
7365,This was hell,1.8,3.3,2.5
7366,Fact The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixtyeight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and fortythree meters per second or one thousand one hundred twentyfive feet per second,3.1,3.1,3.1
7367,I mean sure Id had my moment of elation when I had first realized Id been rescued but it didnt sink in,3.5,3.25,3.12
7368,After watching my ship tear apart after spending a good twentythree hours floating in silence in the wreck wondering whether I was currently facing stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth wondering what it felt like to suffocate and after the feeling that yes I was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in it took time for that feeling to dissipate,2.12,3.25,2.5
7369,Fact I wasnt dead,3.1,3.1,3.1
7370,After I realized this I left my quarters,2.88,2.62,2.75
7371,It hadnt seemed relevant somehow given that I was still reeling over the explosion the deaths of my crewmates and the rescue,2.4,3.5,2.8
7372,Ive heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock I guess I was working my way through them,2.0,3.37,3.0
7373,Initially I couldnt figure out whyI hadnt requested any be sent,2.7,2.8,3.0
7374,Then I realized someone must have noticed I hadnt left and was nice enough to send food my way,3.4,3.1,3.1
7375,The accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch,3.75,3.0,3.12
7376,I must have consumed it too because later on the plates and the bottle were both empty,3.0,3.0,2.75
7377,I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling or slumped in the oldfashioned armchair staring out the windows at the stars,2.86,2.43,2.72
7378,I did a lot of staring and not moving,2.9,2.9,2.9
7379,Fact Hell is other people,2.17,2.67,2.66
7380,Sure the ship was spacious,3.38,3.25,3.38
7381,But we were all on this ship and we were on it together,3.2,3.2,3.3
7382,Metaphorically of course,3.0,2.9,2.9
7383,The plate by the way was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish paprikadusted deviled eggs toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese and balls of meat smothered in a tomatobased sauce,3.11,3.0,3.0
7384,Luxurious even compared to the fare one would find in the highclass space stations and pleasure cruisers,3.2,3.3,3.1
7385,Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship it was mouthwateringly lipsmackingly gorgeous,3.86,3.86,3.43
7386,I decided it couldnt have been,2.7,2.7,3.2
7387,Liking the taste of the sweet life eh,3.8,3.5,3.3

7389,Im Sarah and this is Alexisyou must be the new pickup,3.22,3.11,3.11
7390,She looked me over approvingly,3.33,3.44,2.89
7391,Come on lets get you a glass of champagne,3.37,3.0,3.75
7392,It turned toward Sarahs wave and acknowledged her with a nod moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her,3.4,3.0,3.2
7393,I marveled at the robots smoothness and coordination,3.45,3.09,3.18
7394,Clearly it was a highend model,3.2,3.2,3.1
7395,Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions with Alexis trailing after us,3.18,3.27,2.82
7396,I spent the evening listening mostly,3.0,3.0,2.88
7397,Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided,3.12,3.12,3.12
7398,No one minded Sarahs inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter,3.2,3.1,3.3
7399,Ray a plump man who was grey where he wasnt bald,3.1,2.7,3.1
7400,Zheng short and dark and lean with a very intense gaze,3.1,3.1,3.0

7402,Kishori petite her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist,3.1,2.9,3.2
7403,Most of their chatter was meaningless to mestories of daytoday activities how soandso had been seen in soandsos table at lunch and my wasnt that a surprise and why hadnt the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth didnt they and this was somehow an interesting fact,2.88,3.12,3.0
7404,After the first halfhour I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight,3.0,2.57,3.29
7405,milkfed,3.0,3.0,3.0
7406,accidental,2.89,3.0,2.78
7407,What is even more shocking is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel painful deaths each year,2.3,3.1,2.9
7408,needless deaths that could have been stopped,1.7,3.9,2.9
7409,And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people like you to help us bring an end to animal suffering abuse and neglect,2.3,3.1,3.0
7410,Since 1954 our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties,3.0,3.2,3.3
7411,We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty,3.0,3.14,3.57
7412,Your name and the name of The Humane Society of the United States HSUS are very important to the wellbeing of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives,3.22,3.0,3.22
7413,But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources,2.78,3.11,2.78
7414,It’s a difficult problem because we have to fight the wellfinanced and powerful agribusiness and research industries but we do our best to protect the animals,3.0,3.29,3.29
7415,Right now the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty,2.6,3.3,3.1
7416,And that’s where you can help,3.29,3.43,3.29
7417,You can be a lifesaving friend to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safeguarding the lives of ALL animals,3.63,3.5,3.37

7457,I talk about it in my Green Culture talk,3.0,3.1,2.9
7458,It seems like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees finance types,2.62,2.63,2.75
7459,April 27 2009 1207 PM Padraic Ryan Re cap trade you shouldnt use the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics,2.8,3.0,3.2
7460,A cap trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the US finance types and all,3.6,2.9,3.3
7461,IMHO we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon footprint now,3.0,3.4,3.4
7462,Youre right that a carbon tax is definitely simpler but there are upsides to cap trade as well such as the fact that the market will drive the price up whereas a tax wont increase unless Congress wants it to,3.1,2.8,3.0
7463,Re your green culture talk I think you are misappropriating the Gore clip isnt he saying that your money would be better spent on political candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of externalities changing the laws instead of on carbon offsets changing the lightbulbs,3.0,3.3,3.1
7464,My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is that given the finite amount of money energy and attention we have to push for the environment I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is too high compared to policyoriented actions the citizen role that Gore referred,2.75,2.75,3.0
7465,For example Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were a global rally for carbon taxes instead we depoliticize it and entertain the idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change,2.6,3.2,3.0
7466,Im a big fan of your work on IP and corruption but Im skeptical of these initial ventures into the environmental arena,2.6,3.3,2.8
7467,I am suspicious of cap trade It seems like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees finance types My sense is for a simpler system,2.7,3.1,2.9
7468,It seems like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees finance types,2.7,3.1,3.1

7471,I use it to calculate how many Ill get towards my premier status,3.1,2.9,3.2
7472,Its a tiny link they move around from time to time but look for it near where the seat selection option is,3.1,3.0,3.1
7473,One reason were late other than the obvious is the insane complexity in calculating it well,2.91,2.91,3.09
7474,You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket and possibly also after,3.0,3.0,3.0
7475,April 27 2009 445 PM Brad Templeton When I got to Uniteds site it has two columns one for true miles flown sort of and one for elite bonus,3.0,3.0,3.2
7476,So cut and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine,3.2,2.8,3.1
7477,However it does show 500 for the short haul flights but I bet those are mostly LA so you can fill in the real mileage to LA on those it should not take long,3.0,3.0,3.33

7480,United carbon offset disappointment April 27 2009 908 AM,2.4,3.0,2.9
7481,Paying someone else to do something they are doing already does not reduce your carbon footprint one bit,2.5,3.1,3.0
7482,If you dont believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume less then please consider paying me,2.8,3.2,3.3
7483,My wife and I telecommute,3.0,3.0,3.0

7492,I would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from Prof Lessig or anyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle,3.44,3.33,3.44
7493,In return I would submit to an audit of my lifestyle and I would issue him a certificate stating the amount of his carbon offset,3.0,2.64,3.09

7501,But I want something more accurate,2.82,3.09,3.64
7502,Jutta Kill of the Forests and the European Union Resource Network FERN was the most vehement opponent of the practice arguing it probably did more harm than good,2.8,3.1,3.1
7503,Carbon offsetting was an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing emissions she argued and its effects were impossible to verify,2.5,3.0,2.75
7504,In addition More than half of the money given to companies selling carbon offsets went on research and administration costs benefiting not the climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry,2.8,3.1,2.9
7505,So I was really happy to see on the United page an announcement of a Carbon Offset Program,3.67,3.0,3.11
7506,benefiting not the climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry,2.56,2.78,2.89
7507,We believe it is worse than nothing because it creates the illusion or the impression in the public that action is being taken while we are not really addressing the task at hand significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions,2.64,3.09,2.73

7511,Ive posted your feedback on my carbon offsets news blog,3.0,2.6,2.9
7512,Carbon Offset Program,3.12,2.88,3.12
7513,What I expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what the total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was after all they have all the data and ideally a simple way to buy offsets,3.1,3.0,3.1
7514,Additionally there is a reluctance to share the data required for accurate emissions measurement due to perceived potential risks possibly related to future regulatory concerns,2.8,2.8,3.1
7515,The technology is certainly available,3.5,3.3,3.3
7516,When the type of program you imagine IS put in place the results have been very good,3.5,3.4,3.3
