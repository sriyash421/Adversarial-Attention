915,not surprisingli much of the critic of moor film is misguid or outright wrong often vastli more inaccur than moor work itself,2.8,3.0,3.1
916,thi is a common techniqu but becaus conserv reader are not familiar with the basic of filmmak they believ critic who claim that he is distort the interview,2.9,2.9,3.0
917,what he doe is standard filmmak practic,3.0,3.0,3.0
918,the same goe for the interview which follow,2.91,2.82,3.0
919,moor critic would expect us to have him quot heston in hi entireti have him present fulli the PR that the nra ha use to justifi it ralli in denver for reason of balanc,2.8,3.1,3.3
920,the nra wa fulli awar of the scandal it would caus through it ralli and decid to push on becaus they believ to have enough media support to success do so,3.0,3.0,3.0
921,they were right,3.4,3.0,3.2
922,you claim that there wa no way to chang locat sinc you have to give advanc notic of that to the member and there were upward of member,2.67,2.89,2.89
923,day are more than enough to give advanc warn of a chang in locat or date had the nra realli want to,2.78,3.22,3.33
924,that doe not chang the fact that they did just that,2.8,2.8,2.9
925,thi is what good documentari filmmak is about,3.5,3.2,3.2
926,and here the critic again ignor import evid,2.2,3.0,2.9
927,when heston mention the mayor of denver the crowd boo loudli,2.5,3.2,2.8
928,heston maganim hold up a hand to read the mayor letter onli to explain in detail whi he chose to ignor the request not mention at all the reason you have given,2.5,3.25,2.75
929,thi boo by the crowd not mention with a singl word in your transcript or your articl show that the crowd wa fulli awar of the controversi they would caus by come to littleton after children were be kill there and they effect said fuck you,1.7,3.7,3.4
930,fuck you,1.2,4.2,3.8
931,the kayla rolland case,3.0,2.88,3.12
932,the ralli took place on octob the shoot on februari,2.56,3.0,3.0
933,again standard filmmak techniqu are interpret as smooth distort,2.9,2.8,3.0
934,It is brilliantli if uneth done,2.78,3.0,3.11
935,As note abov the from my cold dead hand part is simpli moor way to introduc heston,3.0,2.89,3.0
936,did anyon but moor critic view it as anyth els,3.0,2.75,3.0
937,He certainli doe not attribut it to a speech where it wa not utter and as note abov do so twice would make no sens whatsoev if moor wa the mastermind deceiv that hi critic claim he is,3.0,2.89,3.11
938,concern the georgetown hoya interview where heston wa ask about rolland you write there is no indic that heston recogn kayla rolland case,2.9,3.1,2.9
939,even if he did not respond to that part of the interview he certainli knew about the case at that point,3.0,3.1,3.1
940,regard the nra websit excerpt about the case and the highlight of the phrase hour after kayla rolland is pronounc dead,2.7,3.1,3.0
941,thi is one valid critic but far from the deliber distort you make it out to be rather it is an exampl for how the fact can sometim be easi to miss with moor fast pace edit,3.0,2.8,3.0
942,hi documentari is full of subtl humor jawdrop dialogu and dark contrast,3.1,3.2,2.8
943,the reason the sentenc is highlight is not to deceiv the viewer into believ that heston hurri to flint to immedi hold a ralli there as will becom quit obviou but simpli to highlight the first mention of the name kayla rolland in the text which is in thi paragraph,3.1,2.9,3.2
944,unfortun becaus the zoom is rather fast it is easi to miss the rest of the sentenc so as you correctli note some viewer got an incorrect impress,2.7,2.9,3.1
945,It would have been fair for moor to point out thi possibl misinterpret on hi websit,3.0,2.5,2.9
946,howev the claim of deliber distort is ludicr for sever reason,2.7,3.2,3.3
947,befor he came to flint,3.0,2.86,3.0
948,In the excerpt from said interview we can see that it is from march,3.0,2.86,2.86
949,all in all it is an accur portray of america gun and violenc cultur,2.89,2.89,3.22
950,If moor want to deceiv hi viewer whi would he say thi and show the month the interview wa publish,2.88,3.12,3.0
951,b whi should moor leav the word clinton is on the today show visibl in the text which is necessari to correctli interpret the highlight part,3.0,3.25,3.25
952,I review the sequenc sever time and it is perfectli possibl to see thi text without paus,2.9,3.0,3.2
953,c both the soccer mom interview and the sequenc show the nra ralli make no effort to distort the fact that thi ralli happen month after the fact,2.8,2.9,3.1
954,the camera linger on bushcheney poster and the protestor is quot as say that we want to let the nra know that we havent forgotten about kayla rolland,2.4,2.8,3.2
955,you make the hyster claim that the interview may be fake on the basi that no name is shown for the interviewe but if moor had fake it whi the hell should he put thi sentenc in the protestor mouth which directli contradict the conclus that the ralli happen hour after kayla death,2.36,3.18,3.18
956,It also rais question about america foreign polici of recent decad question which have been all but ignor by moor critic,2.8,3.3,3.1
957,thi make no sens,2.37,3.25,3.0
958,opinion may vari on how tasteless it wa for heston to hold a pro gun ralli on the locat of the nation youngest school shoot month after the fact but thi sequenc of bowl is without doubt the most unfair to heston,2.5,3.4,2.8
959,the claim of deliber distort dont hold up when view the whole scene though as hanlon razor state one should never attribut to malic what can be attribut to incompet,2.7,3.0,2.9
960,the somewhat inept edit of the nra press releas ha led some viewer to wrong conclus which is unfortun but moor critic have no interest in view the matter fairli,2.8,2.8,2.9
961,In ani case at no point doe moor make a fals statement in contradict to claim by critic that hi documentari is full of lie,3.0,3.14,3.14
962,have creat the desir impress moor follow with hi heston interview,3.3,3.1,3.2
963,the heston interview is at the veri end of the movi,3.0,3.0,3.0
964,On your webpag you state that moor resolut is question,3.0,2.89,2.89
965,moor resolut is question,2.6,2.9,3.1
966,after all earli in the movi he discard the possibl that play violent video game and watch violent flick can caus violenc becaus canadian like and japanes posit love those,3.0,3.2,3.2
967,these peopl do not feel the need to express sympathi or to think about way to avoid such incid but they feel the need to assert their right and to look for quick simpl answer as busch state gun owner want to hang the child from the highest tree,2.18,3.64,2.91
968,thi is all not mention by critic of moor movi who claim to be object,2.9,2.9,2.9
969,moor answer a simpl question how could the scene have been film with a simpl answer two camera,2.9,3.0,3.1
970,from thi you construct an obscur conspiraci of reenact for all we can tell moor could have shout hey to make heston turn around and then remain silent as heston left,3.0,3.0,3.12
971,for all we can tell moor could have shout hey to make heston turn around and then remain silent as heston left,3.11,3.22,3.11
972,hey,3.12,3.63,3.0
973,even if your reenact theori is true and I see no evid that you have actual tri to ask the peopl involv in the filmmak for their opinion thi itself is not uneth and you have no evid whatsoev that moor ha done anyth uneth here just like you have no evid that moor ha uneth remov part of the interview,2.8,3.0,3.5
974,you use standard filmmak techniqu as a basi to construct bizarr conspiraci which sound plausibl to the gullibl reader without ever provid ani evid for the implicit or explicit claim of fraud and distort,2.73,2.91,3.27
975,histori of the US Of cours the cartoon is highli oversimplifi and most critic consid it one of the weakest part of the film,2.8,2.7,3.2
976,but it make a valid claim which you ignor entir that the strategi to promot gun right for white peopl and to outlaw gun possess by black peopl wa a way to uphold racism without let an openli terrorist organ like the kkk flourish,2.5,2.9,3.0
977,did the centuri nra in the southern state promot gun right for black peopl,2.83,2.83,2.83
978,I highli doubt it,2.73,3.0,3.18
979,but if they didnt one of their function wa to continu the racism of the kkk,2.6,3.1,3.4
980,thi is the key messag of thi part of the anim which is again be ignor by it critic,2.37,2.87,2.88
981,If violent movi and violent videogam can not caus violenc then how can newscast about violenc do so,2.37,3.63,3.12
982,buell shoot in flint,2.6,3.1,3.0
983,you write fact the littl boy wa the class thug alreadi suspend from school for stab anoth kid with a pencil and had fought with kayla the day befor,2.5,3.0,3.3
984,fact the littl boy wa the class thug alreadi suspend from school for stab anoth kid with a pencil and had fought with kayla the day befor,2.57,3.29,3.43
985,thi character of a sixyearold as a pencilstab thug is exactli the kind of hysteria that moor film warn against,2.2,3.5,3.3
986,It is the typic rightw reaction which look for simpl answer that do not contradict the republican mindset,3.0,3.3,3.4
987,the kid wa a littl bastard and the parent were involv in drug case close,2.3,3.3,3.1
988,but whi do peopl deal with drug,2.88,3.13,3.37
989,becaus it so much fun to do so,3.5,3.2,3.0
990,It is equal well known that the socal war on drug begun under the nixon administr is a failur which ha cost hundr of billion and made america the world leader in prison popul both in rel and absolut number,2.5,3.3,3.0
991,but the real caus here are not the drug themselv but poverti and the war on drug,2.6,2.9,2.9
992,thi is a faulti gener,2.44,2.89,3.11
993,had the boy mother not been ship to a welfar to work program she might at least have had some time to spend with her son,2.2,3.2,3.1
994,If as moor impli although never state as fact video game and violent movi are rel harmless it doe not logic follow that all type of media present are harmless,2.8,3.0,3.2
995,onc again your emphasi on the littl boy as a thug confirm moor and busch assert that peopl want to hang the child from the highest tree instead of look at the real caus,2.4,3.3,2.7
996,that becaus while there is a socal war on drug there is no war on poverti,2.5,3.1,2.8
997,poverti is frequent portray as natur and the poor in america are seen by conserv as vcrowner who are just too lazi to work,2.5,3.25,3.0
998,In realiti what moor describ here is the most vivid exampl of what can onli be call wage slaveri I have ever seen to the detriment of famili,2.6,2.9,2.8
999,It is notabl that the wall street journal reaction to thi segment of the film wa even more dismiss than your It call moor claim preposter,3.0,2.9,2.9
1000,probabl the most comprehens among mani rebutt of the oscarwin documentari,3.1,3.0,3.0
1001,how could he even think about blame poverti and forc labor program for anyth bad that happen,2.37,3.12,2.88
1002,taliban and american aid,3.0,2.8,2.8
1003,after the septemb attack it wa necessari for conserv to somehow explain away the fact that the US govern gave million dollar to the new evildo du jour,2.57,3.29,3.0
1004,never mind the fact that author such as robert scheer warn of aid the taliban as earli as in may,2.86,3.0,3.29
1005,never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motiv but becaus of the taliban violent enforc of the ban on opium poppi,2.7,3.1,3.2
1006,never mind that in a regim that is control by warlord it doe not matter who is author to distribut the aid the rule region warlord will seiz control of it and use it to their own advantag,3.0,3.0,3.0
1007,never mind that thi veri argument ha been use by hawk in opposit to send humanitarian aid to iraq saddam hussein,2.9,3.1,3.2
1008,there is a huge differ for exampl between play a game like quak and listen to a radio broadcast that tell you that your famili will be kill unless you take action to kill other now,2.3,3.4,3.2
1009,never mind that thi is all document on michael moor websit about the film,3.0,2.8,3.1
1010,gun homicid,2.2,3.3,3.2
1011,hi main mistak is that he doe not use popul correct data hi second mistak is that he doe not cite hi sourc and as you correctli point out he probabl use differ report method for the differ countri,2.6,3.0,3.1
1012,A good comparison of intern homicid rate can be found on the rel neutral guncitecom websit,2.8,3.1,3.1
1013,the gun homicid rate for the countri moor mention accord to guncit are japan per per per per state per,2.9,2.8,2.9
1014,critic fail to credit moor with not make the same mistak that some gun control advoc make conclud that gun ownership lead to violenc,2.63,2.88,3.12
1015,In fact moor mention sever counterexampl and more such counterexampl can inde be cite,3.0,3.0,3.1
1016,It is intuit obviou that gun do not actual caus violenc but it is equal intuit obviou that they make the violenc that is commit more deadli,2.5,2.8,3.2
1017,It is the second intuit which gun right group like the nra seek to obscur use fraudul data by the like of john mari lott,2.9,2.9,3.0
1018,If these caus were address gun ownership in the unit state would not be a problem but also unnecessari just like it is in switzerland,2.9,3.0,3.2
1019,canada ammunit purchas,3.0,3.0,3.0
1020,you write bowl show moor casual buy ammunit at an ontario walmart,3.0,3.1,3.2
1021,look at what I a foreign citizen wa abl to do at a local canadian walmart,3.22,3.0,3.0
1022,He buy sever box of ammunit without a question be rais,3.0,3.2,3.0
1023,canadian offici have point out that the buy is fake or illeg,2.6,2.9,2.8
1024,onc again you fail to distinguish between regular film edit and fake a word which canadian offici have never use for such a distort moor would have been boil aliv by hi critic,2.5,3.2,3.0
1025,hi claim that it is possibl to purchas ammunit in supermarket is independ from that claim,2.78,2.67,2.89
1026,If anyth it is hi own failur that he did not clarifi what he meant with have a more mix ethnic,3.0,2.9,3.1
1027,while thi can in part be explain with hi age and mental condit if he is unabl to defend the interest of the nra he should not be their spokesman,2.9,2.8,2.9
1028,In thi case hanlon razor can be appli to heston he is probabl not racist but incompet,2.9,2.8,3.1
1029,If heston make himself look like a fool that should hardli be blame on michael moor,2.67,3.33,3.33
1030,conclus,3.0,2.9,3.1
1031,you write bowl for columbin is dishonest,2.7,3.1,3.0

1181,becaus of thi I will ignor other ant speci in the design of anti and will not creat a fight behavior,3.0,2.8,2.8
1182,common behavior will includ a forward cruis and turn mechan procedur to determin the orient toward nest and the distanc from the nest when outsid innest navig an escap function for when object are detect or bump into object identif and grip a gener algorithm for pheromon plume and chemic trail follow and the identif of other ant,3.0,2.9,3.0
1183,scienc fiction writer have been anticip humanoid android that could pass a ture test for year,3.1,3.0,3.0
1184,the ant the robot,3.0,2.8,3.0
1185,ant of thi speci are of two type breed ant queen and drone and steril femal worker,2.9,3.1,3.1
1186,these behavior will often be use in other subroutin run on a schema basi and when combin with the forward cruis function should caus the robot to move at an angl,3.0,3.0,3.12
1187,In order to orient itself toward the nest while navig outsid anti will need to determin which direct the nest is in and rotat toward that head and also how far from the nest it is at it current locat,3.0,2.67,3.11
1188,anti will therefor have a polar function that will return a compass direct toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and a distanc function that will return the shortest direct distanc,3.0,2.89,3.22
1189,We may assum that thi first function will return a direct in degre posit or neg and that the second function will return a distanc in centimet,3.1,2.7,3.1
1190,queen and drone will not be consid in thi propos as their behavior and design is much more special and would be applic onli dure the breed season which occur but onc per year,3.0,3.0,3.0
1191,the first function might look someth like thi,3.0,3.0,3.0
1192,To exit anti will seek a high temperatur until the photoreceptor reach a threshold of stimul indic sunlight and to get deeper anti will seek a lower temperatur,3.0,2.75,2.88

1201,becaus thi function respond to the sensor on anti s around the side and onli it sonar detector will be abl to detect object in front of it thi escap function will not prevent anti from be abl to locat and pick up object such as seed,3.09,2.91,3.0
1202,befor pick object up howev anti will need to identifi them,3.0,3.0,3.0
1203,thi object detect process will be activ when the front bump sensor is stimul or when both sonar detector are stimul,3.1,3.0,3.3
1204,chemic input will be check to see what thi object is most like to be given it smell,3.0,3.1,3.2
1205,the code may look someth like thi,3.0,2.4,3.0
1206,nest mainten and seed process are likewis difficult to observ in the deeper region of the nest but the sort and deposit of wast dirt and nest garbag outsid of the nest midden work occur close enough to the surfac to be observ,3.11,3.11,3.22
1207,onc the object ha been identifi anti may grip it and lift it,3.0,2.5,2.8
1208,A simpl void function grip take in no input will tighten the gripper until a certain threshold of pressur is reach at which point the gripper will be lift for carri,3.0,3.14,3.14

1216,for the purpos of call later in the pseudocod I will refer to these subroutin as trailfollow findfood and findmidden,2.9,2.5,3.1
1217,all three are void and take no input,2.7,2.7,3.1
1218,the final common subroutin will be one for the identif of other ant,3.1,2.9,2.9
1219,As harvest ant tend not to engag aggress with nonnestm anti will onli identifi other ant as ant if they belong to it nest,3.0,2.86,3.0
1220,propos for a red harvest ant robot coloni infiltr and task switch,3.0,2.91,3.0
1221,the code will be similar to the object identif subroutin and may look someth like thi,3.0,2.6,2.9
1222,use these basic common behavior more complex behavior may be code,3.0,2.9,3.0
1223,red harvest ant do not retain one task throughout their lifespan but instead chang their behavior as is appropri for the coloni gordon,3.1,2.8,3.0
1224,research ha shown that red harvest ant switch task partial as a function of age ex ingram et al and partial as a function of interact with other worker ex schafer et al gordon green gordon,3.1,2.8,2.9
1225,younger ant work more insid the nest and older ant work more outsid the nest,3.09,2.55,3.0
1226,As a result I will model the three main behavior in the order that they are to be engag in,3.3,3.2,3.3
1227,midden work which consist of move dirt between the insid of the nest and the outsid will occur first patrol which involv a shorter overal amount of time spent outsid will occur second and forag will be the final behavior,3.1,3.1,3.1
1228,final I will discuss a main method encod the task switch between these behavior,3.0,2.88,3.5
1229,the midden work behavior will be anti s default initi behavior,3.14,3.14,3.14
1230,It will be initi in the morn by the sunris and will continu until the outsid temperatur reach at which point all red harvest ant must return to the nest,2.9,3.1,2.9
1231,As previous state a midden worker must identifi midden grasp it and carri it to the surfac deposit it halfway down the mound befor return to collect more midden,2.9,2.7,3.1
1232,A program encod thi behavior might look like thi,3.0,2.88,2.88
1233,these three behavior each present differ puzzl to the ant and to the model though there is some overlap particularli with navig problem,2.88,3.12,3.12
1234,nest patrol will involv leav the nest roam around on the nest mound for a few minut and reenter the nest,3.14,2.86,3.0
1235,thi behavior will be implement in two part with a taskswitch algorithm base on age,3.0,3.11,3.11
1236,research show that ant do chang their behavior base partli on their perceiv life expect moron et al and that taskswitch is partli genet control by a switch in gene express as the individu age ingram et al,2.88,2.75,3.12
1237,harvest ant display a prefer to wander in familiar territori though forag and patrol do sometim wander into other nest territori gordon,3.0,2.9,3.1
1238,In the case of midden work anti must be abl to identifi garbag grasp it carri it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound befor return to repeat the process ad infinitum or until stimul to switch behavior,3.0,3.2,3.1
1239,To control for thi behavior anti s explor subroutin will display a prefer for explor in place where there is a low gradient of nestmat pheromon,3.1,2.7,3.2
1240,thi model is reason becaus patrol and forag chang their explor territori from day to day even though they do retain some more commonli chosen path gordon,3.0,2.9,2.9
1241,the code may look someth like thi,3.0,3.0,3.14
1242,patrol may be divid into two distinct subbehavior nest patrol and trail patrol,3.0,3.0,3.0
1243,trail patrol will go much further until food sourc are found and will then orient toward the nest and creat trail for the forag to follow,3.0,3.0,3.1
1244,An ant engag in nest patrol must exit the nest at the proper time in the morn and wander about for a bit on the nest mound presum take measur of the temperatur and humid in some way and make sure that it is safe for the other ant to exit,3.0,3.0,3.0
1245,A gener site of food is all that the patrol need find the forag will dig through the sand for the food,3.1,3.0,3.2
1246,code for the patrol behavior might look like thi note that part is on a schema basi,3.0,2.5,3.0
1247,the integ nestpatrolag and trailpatrolag will repres the age at which it is appropri to switch to these task,2.9,2.8,3.0
1248,perhap the level of degrad of the nest patrol cuticular hydrocarbon after thi short foray into the sun and heat act as an indic of the outsid condit to the forag who may then upon smell the return patrol be stimul either to forag or to remain inact insid the nest,3.0,3.0,3.0
1249,the final behavior forag will involv one extra subroutin that will employ an algorithm design by R,3.0,2.89,3.11
1250,andrew russel to local an object through sand base on a chemic plume,3.0,2.7,3.1
1251,thi will emul the dig that forag must often do in order to locat seed and will enabl anti to accur retriev seed for it host nest,3.0,3.1,3.1
1252,thi algorithm will keep track of the last two intens of the desir chemic input and compar them,3.0,2.62,2.88
1253,the code for thi adapt from russel s paper might look like thi,3.0,2.83,3.17
1254,forag will follow trail mark by patrol to their conclus befor collect food to bring back to the nest even if more tantal food present itself in their path gordon,3.0,3.14,3.29
1255,To address thi a strict subsumpt hierarchi will make sure that the forag do not stop to collect food too soon,3.0,2.86,3.0
1256,the code might look like thi,3.0,2.8,3.1
1257,An ant engag in trail patrol must exit the nest wander around search for food sourc identifi food upon discoveri and return to the nest to show the forag where the food is,3.12,3.25,3.12
1258,becaus the midden work behavior is anti s initi default behavior I will not address task switch to midden work,2.9,2.9,3.4
1259,infiltr insect societi howev is much simpler,2.89,2.67,3.0
1260,thi is thought to be accomplish by the deposit of chemic marker from a gland on the abdomen that the patrol drag along the ground on her return rout to the nest that the forag may then follow gordon holldobl et al as cite in webb,3.0,3.0,3.0
1261,activ forag form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steadi rate,3.0,2.8,3.3
1262,accord to schafer s et al model of forag activ everi time a success forag return and no forag are current in line to exit a fraction model at of inact forag join the queue,3.0,2.88,3.0
1263,for the purpos of model anti I will assum that the switch between these behavior are perman irrevers and partli a function of age with new forag be activ by return success forag,2.88,2.75,3.0
1264,the code to model thi taskswitch might look someth like thi,3.11,2.89,3.0
1265,anti will be a fulli autonom situat and embodi agent infiltr a red harvest ant coloni and provid valuabl inform not onli about the hypothes rule of these ant behavior and their taskswitch threshold but also about the combin of complex behavior into a singl autonom system with the abil to switch between behavior as necessari,3.2,3.3,3.2
1266,In addit to follow these trail to the food forag must also be abl to identifi food grasp it and carri it back to the nest,3.0,3.14,3.29
1267,biomimet robot have long been a rich sourc of inform for both biologist and robot engin and complex robot that can switch task as the situat demand and commun inform about current task could be use for further studi of complex robot behavior as well as for the obviou practic applic of robot swarm such as on the battlefield and standard build mainten,3.0,2.78,3.0

1275,sensor will includ a thermomet photoreceptor bump sensor a polar compass and a seri of chemic receptor,3.0,3.0,3.1
1276,anti be a circular robot no more than in diamet the length of a red harvest ant with two drive wheel and one rear wheel for stabil,3.1,2.8,3.2
1277,A gripper will be locat on the front of the robot consist of two elong tong,3.11,2.89,3.44
1278,these sac will be refil at a fill station each morn as anti determin that they are get deplet,3.11,2.67,2.89
1279,anti will likewis recharg at a special station at night just insid the nest entranc,3.14,3.14,3.14
1280,for the purpos of thi propos I will assum that anti ha enough batteri life to remain power the whole day,3.0,2.7,3.4
1281,A rudimentari blueprint of anti is attach,3.0,2.8,3.2
1282,In an attempt to mimic the red harvest ant as close as possibl these sensor includ a thermomet photoreceptor bump sensor and sonar a polar compass and a seri of chemic receptor on a pair of stalk correspond to the antenna,3.09,2.73,3.0
1283,On it front gripper anti will have a tactil skin to sens pressur,3.0,2.88,3.25
1284,the locat of the rest of these sensor will depend on their function,3.0,2.75,3.13
1285,the thermomet will be locat on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way and will detect and input to the robot the outsid temperatur in degre celsiu,3.0,3.0,3.2
1286,harvest ant do not exit the nest when the outsid temperatur is abov degre celsiu gordon and the abil to use a temperatur gradient will enabl innest navig,3.0,2.83,3.17
1287,anti will also be equip with one photoreceptor locat in the middl of the top of it chassi correspond to the ant s eye,3.0,2.73,3.09
1288,these will be use for initi patrol behavior in the morn and shut off behavior at night the patrol first poke their head out of the nest shortli after sunris and scuttl back in at night gordon,3.12,3.0,3.0
1289,No robot ha yet been construct howev that could pass undetect within a coloni of the red harvest ant speci pogonomyrmex barbatu nor ha a robot manag to pass undetect in a societi of insect while combin in it design sever differ behavior and the threshold of stimul requir to switch between them,2.9,3.0,2.9
1290,the bump sensor and sonar will form a skirt around anti to keep it from collid with other object,3.1,3.1,3.1
1291,the sonar will correspond to the ant s limit optic object detect abil and the bump sensor will allow the robot to detect collis,3.1,3.1,3.3
1292,the polar compass will consist of two polar light sensor place at and degre from the center front of anti respect that will orient anti toward a desir polar pattern,3.1,3.1,3.1
1293,these sensor would correspond to the cell in the ant eye sensit to polar light and research ha shown that mani insect includ ant do navig use a path integr system synthes input from a polar compass and from a sort of odomet labhart et al,2.9,3.0,3.1
1294,thi should be suffici to return anti to the nest given the accuraci achiev by lambrino et al and the rel short period of time that harvest ant spend outsid the nest befor return,3.0,2.75,3.25

1339,paul wilson describ the transit from the introduct to the exposit as quit abrupt and seemingli unmotiv,2.7,3.1,2.4
1340,wilson,3.0,2.71,3.29
1341,but it is in fact thi motiv relationship that tie them togeth and creat a rather smooth transit,3.1,2.9,3.4
1342,the exposit,3.0,2.88,3.12
1343,As mention the first theme the begin of which is reproduc in exampl contain two head motiv the first is the tritonespan ascent that appear in the first measur and the second is an iter of the interv cell that appear in the second through third measur,3.0,2.71,2.86
1344,bartók describ the form of the first movement as more or less regular sonata form,3.0,3.0,3.0
1345,while the presenc of the perfect fourth that wa so preval in the introduct is clear in the latter the former doe not employ the perfect fourth in it format,3.0,2.64,3.0
1346,rather thi motiv is a smallscal represent of the tonicdomin relationship of triton partner specif F and B that is the basi for the harmon structur of thi movement,3.0,2.9,3.1
1347,rhythmic we have a disson between the melodi which follow the written meter and the accompani chord in the bassoon horn and lower string,3.0,2.8,3.1
1348,exampl reproduc the chord and exampl rewrit them in a meter that is more consist with their rhythmic pattern,3.0,2.88,3.0
1349,thi is in strict metric disson with the tripl meter of the melodi with it own hiccup occur in the written measur,3.0,2.55,2.91
1350,while that doe not seem to be a meaning assert it is perfectli accur the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduct that doe not relat themat to ani other part of the movement not unheard of in mozart sonata and the recapitul present the two theme of the exposit in revers order,3.0,3.0,3.2
1351,We have alreadi mention that the first theme group is in is made clear from the onset both in the melod line and by the F minor triad that occur on the downbeat of measur,2.9,2.7,3.2
1352,while the materi occasion depart from thi F in measur these departur are all subordin to the prolong F,3.0,2.9,3.3
1353,is the tonal center for measur although it doe not appear as a strong bass note until measur,3.0,3.0,3.0
1354,measur contain a mostli chromat descent from C to where is anticip throughout as a goal tone for the bass,3.0,3.2,3.1
1355,immedi follow the arriv of in the bass is establish as the tonal center for the final transit to the second theme,3.14,2.86,3.0
1356,the trombon motiv in measur shown in exampl is the subject of the fugato section in part of the develop although it import is downplay here,3.0,2.67,3.11
1357,thi motiv also contain the interval cell of the second head motiv of the first theme in the form of with the addit of some pass tone in addit to consist larg of motion by perfect fourth,3.0,2.9,3.0
1358,while the strong VI motion from measur doe carri a tonal implic of dominantton such cadenti bass motion doe not impli anyth about structur function in thi context,3.0,2.89,2.89
1359,the passag from measur is center on and the pentaton set from the open of the exposit is transpos down a whole step but it mere presenc as local tonic doe not signifi ani sort of domin function,3.0,2.7,3.0
1360,rather we can consid thi occurr of as a middlegroundlevel wholeton descent that foreshadow the structur descent to at measur that is repres in exampl,3.0,3.0,3.1
1361,In measur the bass descend which might seem to support C s function as structur domin,3.0,2.7,3.1
1362,howev as previous mention C act as a fake domin that in measur actual function as an upper neighbor to B the true domin,3.0,2.86,3.14
1363,the descent in measur in fact particip in the farc by project a descent end on C which make the eventu reinterpret of C and descent to B stronger,3.1,2.9,2.9
1364,the second theme is tranquil and harmon simpl which is in stark contrast to the first theme,3.14,2.86,3.14
1365,B domin as tonal center from measur with littl or no harmon motion away from it,2.88,2.75,2.88
1366,the backward recapitul is a techniqu that bartók employ frequent becaus of the formal symmetri it creat,3.0,2.86,3.0
1367,measur are in with the bass note in the harp and measur are in,2.9,3.1,3.1
1368,interven between and in measur instanc of the wholeton be fill in by a fourth,3.0,2.38,3.0
1369,the return to B in measur is also filledin in thi way by in measur,3.0,2.6,3.0
1370,paul wilson point out that in substitut for F within an analog structur B receiv confirm at thi point as the crucial interior center of the movement,3.0,2.8,3.0
1371,in substitut for F within an analog structur B receiv confirm at thi point as the crucial interior center of the movement,3.0,3.0,3.0
1372,In our terminolog thi is the point at which B is unequivoc establish as the structur domin,3.0,3.0,3.3
1373,the develop,3.18,2.73,3.0
1374,As mention the develop is divid into three subsect,3.0,2.9,3.2
1375,In exampl the entir develop section is repres by exactli three pitch and inde each subsect is associ with one of these three pitch as it tonal of these pitch is involv in the structur wholeton descent,3.0,2.88,3.0
1376,As paul wilson state the develop is for bartók s music development in a rel convent way the theme from the exposit are expand and modifi and tonal other than those expect aris,3.18,3.09,3.18
1377,is for bartók s music development in a rel convent way,3.0,2.75,2.88
1378,for exampl the fifth string quartet,3.0,2.57,2.86
1379,the onli slight abnorm though it is certainli not unheard of even in classicalperiod sonata movement is the emerg of a new theme in the second section of the develop,3.0,2.9,2.9
1380,although wilson claim that thi theme is base on a transform in rhythm and contour of the second headmot of the firstthem,3.0,3.0,3.0
1381,also see bartók s comment on that bartók,3.0,2.9,2.8
1382,there is no interval relationship between the two motiv and it is not clear what element of a motiv remain when rhythm contour and interv content are chang,2.88,2.75,3.5
1383,befor begin an analysi of ani piec by béla bartók one must first decid to what degre tonal analysi will be use,3.0,3.0,3.0
1384,furthermor thi section be the middl section of the movement uphold the formal symmetri if interpret as it own theme,3.0,3.1,3.1
1385,the first section of the develop measur begin with a big dminor chord which immedi establish D as the tonal center for the section,2.86,3.0,3.29
1386,although it move to minor in measur it return to D minor in measur which suggest that is an upper neighbor prolong D,3.0,3.0,3.0
1387,exampl show a diagram of the form of the movement the symmetri is appar within the seven section follow the introduct,3.0,2.75,3.0
1388,the passag begin at measur shown in exampl can be consid to be the theme of thi section and is a develop of the second head motiv of the first theme,3.0,3.0,3.0
1389,thi motiv undergo invers and extens throughout the section,3.0,2.75,3.12
1390,thi section is reproduc as exampl,3.0,2.88,3.0
1391,the arriv at wa foreshadow by the first two measur of the develop exampl which are almost a direct transposit of the two head motiv of the first theme to,2.8,2.8,3.0
1392,becaus of it emphasi here in the develop section and it posit as lead to B in the second theme group we could conceiv of C as a subdomin in thi movement,3.0,2.82,3.0
1393,As the exampl show the develop section is divid into three subsect the first and third subsect draw their themat materi from the first theme group and the second subsect involv new materi not drawn from the exposit,3.0,3.0,2.9
1394,As tempt as thi interpret may be thi observ is releg to the note section becaus it constitut a horribl abus of is onli so far that such tonal analog can go befor they begin to hide ani true analyt insight behind misus term,2.7,3.3,3.2
1395,the tonal center is establish immedi in measur by the strong VI chord progress exampl,3.0,2.75,3.0
1396,As previous mention the fugato motiv incorpor the motion by perfect fourth found in the introduct as well as the interval cell found in the second head motiv of the first theme,3.0,3.12,3.0
1397,the result set is the pentaton set the entir passag shown in exampl remain within thi set,3.0,2.7,2.8
1398,the second instanc of the fugato section not reproduc in it entireti but base on the subject in exampl is an exact pitch invers transpos to begin on C,3.0,2.44,3.22
1399,the invers blend seamlessli back into the origin subject in measur,3.2,2.8,3.2
1400,the follow section measur especi bring out the quartal harmoni within the pentaton set so much so that is obscur as tonal center which allow to emerg as the goal tone of thi to be immedi reinterpret as a lead tone to the A that begin the recapitul,3.0,2.55,3.0
1401,henc on either side of the middl section of the develop we have the altern ftgstgftg which make the overal form with the except of the introduct symmetr,3.0,3.0,3.0
1402,the recapitul,3.1,3.1,3.1
1403,the recapitul as we have seen present the theme in revers order,3.0,2.6,3.0
1404,the second theme is initi present in A as part of the wholeton descent and proce directli to G where it is restat slightli modifi,3.0,3.0,3.0
1405,It is worth point out that the arriv on G at measur is led into by D which constitut anoth fill in of the wholestep by the interven fourth,3.0,3.0,3.0
1406,the in measur might initi seem to be a new tonal area but it lead to D in measur which constitut a V chord still appli to G,3.0,2.87,3.12
1407,rather than resolv thi D back to G howev bartók shift briefli to in measur and lead to E in measur,3.1,3.1,3.3
1408,E and are both activ throughout the entir transit from second theme back to first theme measur which bring out their function as upper and lower chromat neighbor to F which return triumphantli in measur with the muchanticip recapitul of the first theme,3.38,3.25,3.12
1409,the return of the first theme is certainli immedi recogn as such howev there are some import differ,3.0,3.0,3.22
1410,firstli it initi appear in the exposit had a minor flare to it the first chord in exampl is an fminor triad and the first four note of exampl ascend the fminor scale,3.1,2.6,3.0
1411,paul wilson also discuss the inher symmetri of the movement although hi interpret is somewhat differ,3.0,2.9,3.1
1412,In addit to the mode shift we notic that the metric disson shown in exampl and no longer appear notic how regular the rhythm of the accompani figur is in exampl and also that the written meter no longer chang,3.1,2.8,3.1
1413,In other word the piec in becom more regular is begin to drive toward the of the formal structur the recapitul of the first theme also serv as the close section of the movement,3.1,2.8,3.1
1414,inde thi section ha the feel of a coda to is much shorter than ani other major section or subsect and the tonic harmoni is activ throughout,3.1,2.9,2.9
1415,see wilson,3.0,2.8,3.0
1416,bartók is one of the mani earlytwentieth centuri compos whose music fit entir in the gray area between tonal and aton,3.12,3.25,3.12
1417,while we know from hi write that he often compos with a tonal center and relationship in mind and that he regularli appli tonal structur and form to hi composit by mere glanc at ani one of hi piec we can see that tonal as it is understood in the common practic period is not at work,3.1,3.1,3.1
1418,thank larg to the work of tonal theorist such as heinrich schenker and other we have a detail system for analyz tonal system howev is virtual useless in analyz music that fall entir on the aton side of the spectrum,3.2,3.1,3.2
1419,but if we appli it to music such as bartók s that is in the middl area we can come up with some enlighten and perhap unexpect result,3.1,3.0,3.0
1420,To do so wa the goal of thi analysi of the first movement of the concerto for orchestra,3.0,2.8,3.0
1421,By appli our tonal system to music that slip outsid of the tonal realm we not onli find the element of tonal that do remain but we also pinpoint exactli when and how thi music break from previou convent,3.1,2.7,3.3
1422,It is not disput that bartók s music ha great express now we can understand whi,3.18,3.0,3.09
1423,refer,3.0,2.89,3.0
1424,bartók s music although it is often difficult to call complet tonal never entir shed itself of tonal element and structur,2.88,2.88,2.88
1425,when we say in F we do not impli F major or minor for that majorminor tonal system in gener doe not appli to thi rather that the pitchclass F is the tonal center of the movement and act analog to the tonic in a mozartian sonata movement,3.0,2.9,3.1
1426,use thi interpret we can map out the local tonic tonal center use throughout the movement as shown in exampl,3.0,2.5,3.1
1427,tonal structur and form in bartók s concerto for orchestra I,3.0,2.57,3.28
1428,In thi exampl the barlin divid the formal section of the piec we can immedi see that the tonic F is not establish until the exposit begin,3.1,3.2,3.0
1429,thi remain true even with one of hi last composit the concerto for orchestra written two year befor hi death in,2.8,2.7,3.3
1430,see bartók,3.0,2.78,3.0
1431,In thi particular movement bartók feign move to the tonal domin C for the second theme befor reinterpret C as a chromat pass tone between and and other subtleti shown in exampl will be explain in detail in later section,2.9,2.9,3.2
1432,the graph in exampl will serv as a point of departur for the subsequ analysi while we will period refer back to some of it specif element it should be understood that even when not explicitli referenc thi graph serv as the explanatori goal of thi paper,3.0,2.6,3.2
1433,the introduct,3.0,2.78,2.89
1434,As paul wilson point out the titl introduzion given to the movement as a whole seem to appli onli to the first measur,3.0,2.9,2.9
1435,the discuss that follow analyz the first movement of the concerto focus on the tonal structur at play throughout the movement,3.0,2.9,2.9
1436,To begin with the open motiv in the celli and bass shown in exampl outlin a pentaton set and strongli present as the tonal center,3.0,2.9,3.0
1437,inde thi set can be seen more as a byproduct of stack perfect fourth than a gener element itself,2.9,2.5,3.1
1438,furthermor the follow two instanc of thi open motiv shown in exampl and remov ani doubt as to the motiv import of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the import of the pentaton set,3.0,2.63,3.37
1439,exampl transit from to and add pitchclass E to the pentaton set of exampl creat a sixnot set of stack fourth,3.1,2.8,3.1
1440,each note is either approach or left or both by a fourth and the structur motion is from to,3.0,2.9,2.9
1441,the overal motion in the first measur is to through these are repres enharmon in exampl as and,3.1,3.0,3.1
1442,As previous mention thi motion constitut the initi ascent to what will eventu be a wholeton descent from F to F,2.8,2.9,2.9
1443,So the prevail structur motion of the movement as a whole is a descend whole step and the prevail melod motion is a usual ascend perfect fourth,3.1,3.1,3.2
1444,We can connect the two by note that the descend whole step consist of two ascend fourth inde the structur wholeton descent is often fill in with the interven fourth,2.9,2.9,2.9
1445,thi motion is exemplifi in exampl in the second theme group mm,3.0,3.0,3.1
1446,We will also examin to what degre a tonal read of thi movement is limit in it analyt potenti in an attempt to pinpoint exactli where bartók stray from commonpractic composit techniqu,3.0,2.86,2.86
1447,and as we will see it occur in other place though not relev enough to the background structur to be repres in exampl,3.0,2.8,3.0
1448,each time the motion in exampl through break from chain of fourth the same sequenc of interv occur two descend perfect fourth separ by an ascend major second each instanc of thi interval cell is bracket in the exampl,3.1,2.9,2.9
1449,thi sequenc of interv is the invers of those found in the second head motiv of the first theme of the exposit shown in measur of exampl,3.0,2.9,3.0
1450,So although there is no themat relat between the introduct and the main section of the movement within the first measur we can alreadi see structur harmon and motiv element that appli to the movement as a whole,3.0,3.11,3.0
1451,the section from measur is center on E upon the return of enharmon respel as in measur we see that E act as it upperneighbor,3.0,2.71,3.0
1452,thi relationship is somewhat obscur by measur howev while there is no clear tonal center for thi section G appear in the outer voic in measur although the harmon materi is reminisc of C minor,3.0,2.67,3.0
1453,the conclud motiv of thi section in the violin the bracket section of exampl as well as the bass motiv of measur,3.0,2.9,2.9
1454,exampl are relat to the first head motiv of the first theme which is shown in the first measur of exampl,3.0,2.7,2.9
1455,all three of these motiv span a triton which as mention is the domin relationship in thi movement,3.0,2.6,3.3
1456,becaus of thi it is possibl to take up ani given color and make them harmon,3.12,3.0,3.38
1457,whi in a world fill with color do we feel the need to purg it from our space,2.8,2.8,3.0

1460,In the white paint room the clariti of spatial sensat and disposit wa surest and most convinc all the detail of the form and color of the furnish could be develop undisturb in front of thi thi a form wa discov which wa complet convinc in it simplic and which could be seen as one of the essenti formula for wall treatment in close space,3.0,2.78,3.22
1461,In the centuri it becam fashion for bourgeoi women to dress in white while men dress in black wigley,3.0,2.6,2.8

1463,white wall white cloth they both requir much more mainten than someth color where a stain can mere hide away among the other color,3.0,2.62,3.12
1464,crisp white on the other hand express a sort of luxuri and leisur,3.4,3.1,3.1

1466,the same goe with white wall in their impecc it prove to whoever that the owner could afford to not live actual live in thi space or could afford more simpli for the upkeep and constant fresh coat of paint,3.0,3.11,3.11
1467,both as well were sign of the modern age man had reach,3.22,3.22,3.22

1478,thi world wa view as orderli and rel uniform a world in black and white,3.14,3.14,3.14
1479,thi led to the idea of write ration product that confin imag especi imag in color to the emerg field of art which wa understood as an essenti activ but one that wa essenti unproduct while it assign to the twoton and orderli world of print paper the role of a daili guid to exist,3.0,2.9,3.0
