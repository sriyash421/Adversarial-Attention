1342,the exposition,3.0,2.88,3.12
1343,"as mentioned , the first theme , the beginning of which is reproduced in example 8 , contains two head motives : the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure , and the second is an iteration of the interval cell ( +5 , -2 , +5 ) that appears in the second through third measures .",3.0,2.71,2.86
1344,bartk describes the form of the first movement as more or less regular sonata form .,3.0,3.0,3.0
1345,"while the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the introduction is clear in the latter , the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation .",3.0,2.64,3.0
1346,"rather , this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners , specifically f and b , that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement .",3.0,2.9,3.1
1347,"rhythmically , we have a dissonance between the melody , which follows the written meter , and the accompanying chords in the bassoons , horns and lower strings .",3.0,2.8,3.1

1350,"while that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion , it is perfectly accurate : the movement is in sonata form , but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement ( not unheard of in mozart sonatas ) , and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order .",3.0,3.0,3.2
1351,"we have already mentioned that the first theme group is in fthis is made clear from the onset , both in the melodic line and by the f minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77 .",2.9,2.7,3.2

1357,"this motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of g-c-b-e ( with the addition of some passing tones ) , in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths .",3.0,2.9,3.0
1358,"while the strong v-i motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic , such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context .",3.0,2.89,2.89
1359,"the passage from measures 85-89 is centered on e ( and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step ) , but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function .",3.0,2.7,3.0
1360,"rather , we can consider this occurrence of e as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to e at measure 131 that is represented in example 2 .",3.0,3.0,3.1
1361,"in measures 91-95 , the bass descends f-e-d-c , which might seem to support cs functioning as structural dominant .",3.0,2.7,3.1
1362,"however , as previously mentioned , c acts as a fake dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to b , the true dominant .",3.0,2.86,3.14
1363,"the descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on c , which makes the eventual reinterpretation of c and descent to b stronger .",3.1,2.9,2.9

1373,the development,3.18,2.73,3.0
1374,"as mentioned , the development is divided into three subsections .",3.0,2.9,3.2
1375,"in example 2 , the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches , and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal centernone of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent .",3.0,2.88,3.0
1376,"as paul wilson states , the development is , for bartks music , developmental in a relatively conventional way ; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified , and tonalities other than those expected arise .",3.18,3.09,3.18
1377,"is , for bartks music , developmental in a relatively conventional way",3.0,2.75,2.88
1378,"for example , the fifth string quartet .",3.0,2.57,2.86
1379,"the only slight abnormality , though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements , is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development .",3.0,2.9,2.9
1380,"although wilson claims that this theme is based on a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [ the first-theme ] ,",3.0,3.0,3.0
1381,"also see bartks comments on that ( bartk , 414 ) .",3.0,2.9,2.8
1382,"there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives , and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm , contour and interval content are changed .",2.88,2.75,3.5
1383,"before beginning an analysis of any piece by bla bartk , one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1384,"furthermore , this section , being the middle section of the movement , upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme .",3.0,3.1,3.1
1385,"the first section of the development , measures 231-271 , begins with a big d-minor chord which immediately establishes d as the tonal center for the section .",2.86,3.0,3.29
1386,"although it moves to e minor in measure 239 , it returns to d minor in measure 248 , which suggests that e is an upper neighbor prolonging d .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1387,example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement ; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction .,3.0,2.75,3.0
1388,"the passage beginning at measure 248 , shown in example 13 , can be considered to be the theme of this section , and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1389,this motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section .,3.0,2.75,3.12
1390,this section is reproduced as example 14 .,3.0,2.88,3.0
1391,"the arrival at c was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development ( example 15 ) , which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to c .",2.8,2.8,3.0
1392,"because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to b in the second theme group , we could conceive of c # as a sub-dominant in this movement .",3.0,2.82,3.0
1393,"as the example shows , the development section is divided into three subsections ; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group , and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition .",3.0,3.0,2.9
1394,"as tempting as this interpretation may be , this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminologythere is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms .",2.7,3.3,3.2
1395,the tonal center b is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong v-i chord progression ( example 16 ) .,3.0,2.75,3.0
1396,"as previously mentioned , the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme .",3.0,3.12,3.0
1397,the resultant set is the pentatonic set f-b-e-a-d ; the entire passage shown in example 17 remains within this set .,3.0,2.7,2.8
1398,"the second instance of the fugato section , not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in example 18 , is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on c .",3.0,2.44,3.22
1399,the inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363 .,3.2,2.8,3.2
1400,"the following section ( measures 363-389 ) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set , so much so that b is obscured as tonal center which allows a to emerge as the goal tone of this sectiononly to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the a that begins the recapitulation .",3.0,2.55,3.0
1401,"hence , on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation ftg-stg-ftg which makes the overall form , with the exception of the introduction , symmetric .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1402,the recapitulation,3.1,3.1,3.1
1403,"the recapitulation , as we have seen , presents the themes in reverse order .",3.0,2.6,3.0
1404,"the second theme is initially presented in a , as part of the whole-tone descent , and proceeds directly to g , where it is restated slightly modified .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1405,"it is worth pointing out that the arrival on g at measure 425 is led into by d , which constitutes another filling in of the whole-step by the intervening fourth .",3.0,3.0,3.0
1406,"the a in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area , but it leads to d in measure 444 , which constitutes a v chord still applied to g .",3.0,2.87,3.12
1407,"rather than resolve this d back to g , however , bartk shifts briefly to f in measure 456 and leads to e in measure 467 .",3.1,3.1,3.3
1408,"e and f are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme ( measures 456-487 ) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to f , which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme .",3.38,3.25,3.12
1409,"the return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such ; however , there are some important differences .",3.0,3.0,3.22
1410,"firstly , its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it ; the first chord in example 9 is an f-minor triad , and the first four notes of example 8 ascend the f-minor scale .",3.1,2.6,3.0
1411,"paul wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement , although his interpretation is somewhat different .",3.0,2.9,3.1
1412,"in addition to the mode-shift , we notice that the metric dissonance shown in examples 9 and 10 no longer appears ( notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in example 19 ) and also that the written meter no longer changes .",3.1,2.8,3.1
1413,"in other words , the piece , in becoming more regular , is beginning to drive towards the finishbecause of the formal structure , the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement .",3.1,2.8,3.1
1414,"indeed , this section has the feel of a coda to itit is much shorter than any other major section or subsection , and the tonic harmony is active throughout .",3.1,2.9,2.9
1415,"see wilson , 168-170 .",3.0,2.8,3.0
1416,bartk is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality .,3.12,3.25,3.12
1417,"while we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind , and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions , by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work .",3.1,3.1,3.1
1418,"thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as heinrich schenker and others , we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal musictheir system , however , is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum .",3.2,3.1,3.2
1419,"but if we apply it to music such as bartks that is in the middle area , we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results .",3.1,3.0,3.0
1420,to do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the concerto for orchestra .,3.0,2.8,3.0
1421,"by applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm , we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain , but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions .",3.1,2.7,3.3

1424,"bartks music , although it is often difficult to call completely tonal , never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure .",2.88,2.88,2.88
1425,"when we say in f , we do not imply f major ( or minor , for that matter ) the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piecebut rather that the pitch-class f is the tonal center of the movement , and acts analogously to the tonic in a mozartian sonata movement .",3.0,2.9,3.1

1432,"the graph in example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis ; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements , it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced , this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper .",3.0,2.6,3.2
1433,the introduction,3.0,2.78,2.89
1434,"as paul wilson points out , the title introduzione given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures .",3.0,2.9,2.9
1435,"the discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the concerto , focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement .",3.0,2.9,2.9
1436,"to begin with , the opening motive in the celli and basses , shown in example 3 , outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents c as the tonal center .",3.0,2.9,3.0
1437,"indeed , this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself .",2.9,2.5,3.1
1438,"furthermore , the following two instances of this opening motive , shown in examples 4 and 5 , remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth , and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set .",3.0,2.63,3.37
1439,"example 4 transitions from c to f , and adds pitch-class e to the pentatonic set of example 3 , creating a six-note set of stacked fourths .",3.1,2.8,3.1
1440,"each note is either approached or left ( or both ) by a fourth , and the structural motion is from f to d .",3.0,2.9,2.9
1441,"the overall motion in the first 29 measures is c to d , through f ; these are represented enharmonically in example 2 as d , e and g .",3.1,3.0,3.1
1442,"as previously mentioned , this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from f to f .",2.8,2.9,2.9
1443,so the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a ( usually ascending ) perfect fourth .,3.1,3.1,3.2
1444,"we can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths ; indeed , the structural whole-tone descent is often filled in with the intervening fourth .",2.9,2.9,2.9
1445,this motion is exemplified in example 2 in the second theme group ( mm .,3.0,3.0,3.1
1446,we will also examine to what degree a tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where bartk strays from common-practice compositional techniques .,3.0,2.86,2.86
1447,"155-233 ) , and as we will see , it occurs in other places , though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in example 2 .",3.0,2.8,3.0
1448,"each time the motion in examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths , the same sequence of intervals occurs : two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second ( -5 , +2 , -5 ) ; each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples .",3.1,2.9,2.9
1449,"this sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition , shown in measures 2-3 of example 8 .",3.0,2.9,3.0
1450,"so although there is no thematic relation between the introduction and the main sections of the movement , within the first 29 measures we can already see structural , harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole .",3.0,3.11,3.0
1451,"the section from measures 35-50 is centered on e ; upon the return of d , enharmonically respelled as e , in measure 58 , we see that e acts as its upper-neighbor .",3.0,2.71,3.0
1452,"this relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however ; while there is no clear tonal center for this section , g appears in the outer voices in measure 51 , although the harmonic material is reminiscent of c minor .",3.0,2.67,3.0
1453,"the concluding motive of this section in the violins ( the bracketed sections of example 6 ) , as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff .",3.0,2.9,2.9
1454,"( example 7 ) , are related to the first head motive of the first theme , which is shown in the first measure of example 8 .",3.0,2.7,2.9

3219,"amy leaned forward , looking amazed .",3.55,3.45,3.09
3220,"the glow reflected on her pink face , casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks .",2.38,3.38,3.0
3221,tiny drops of blood began to seep out of isis palms as her brow creased .,2.4,3.2,3.0
3222,her candy lips twisted into a frown .,2.44,3.22,2.56
3223,"the dark glow grew stronger and larger , filling the air for about a foot around her hands .",2.75,3.25,3.0
3224,"in her palms , the droplets of blood swelled into small pools .",2.5,3.4,2.9
3225,"the dark glow began to flicker , and isis frown of concentration became one of worry .",2.8,3.0,3.0
3226,"she didnt shed a bead of sweat , and i didnt even see her draw a breath , but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame .",2.9,2.9,3.3
3227,then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake .,2.8,3.2,2.9
3228,"the blood in her palms , still filling up , began to ripple .",2.88,3.25,2.63
3229,"he glanced at me with honest concern , probably the first honest moment hed shown me : is she all right ?",3.11,3.11,2.67
3230,is she all right ?,2.7,3.5,2.7
3231,"she gasped and the dark glow went out , taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam .",2.8,3.2,2.9
3232,"isis collapsed on the fur , strings cut .",2.6,3.4,3.1
3233,"she shook her head , rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something .",2.9,3.1,2.8
3234,"she rolled onto her back , her arms crossed tightly over her chest .",2.9,3.3,3.1
3235,"for the first time , she looked vulnerable .",2.7,2.9,2.7
3236,"i found your vampire , she said , but he might know that someones looking for him .",2.7,3.5,3.0
3237,hes taken great pains to keep himself hidden .,2.6,2.9,3.0
3238,you should look for him at dvorovs as quickly as you can .,3.0,3.2,3.1
3239,she turned to me with tired sympathy .,2.9,2.8,3.0
3240,i didnt see a girl with him .,2.8,2.9,3.3
3241,"hurry , though , and you might find him before he leaves .",2.9,3.1,3.1
3242,a twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants .,3.14,3.14,3.71
3243,i looked back to see nepthys whispering something to her .,3.1,3.1,3.1
3244,"he stood to go , but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment .",3.0,3.4,3.2
3245,"there was a terrific echo , each beat reverberating inside of the next , and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames .",2.7,3.1,2.9
3246,i turned back to the door .,3.0,2.78,3.33
3247,"come on , amy , i said , hell be along soon .",3.2,3.3,3.4
3248,"when we got there , another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood .",2.89,2.78,2.89
3249,"he offered it to nepthys , who opened the box : on velvet lining , a wooden hammer and two stakes .",2.9,3.0,3.1
3250,"mountain ash ,",3.0,3.0,3.0
3251,"i really hope we find your rachel , he said .",3.25,3.12,3.12
3252,"i know a quick way to dvorovs ,",3.4,2.9,3.3
3253,"i know a quick way to dvorovs , said nepthys .",3.0,2.8,3.1
3254,i bet hes kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me .,2.86,3.29,3.29
3255,the pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart .,3.0,3.2,3.0
3256,"yo , my man nep !",3.8,3.8,3.0
3257,"no , but we got a tip that he might be in your club .",3.0,2.9,3.4
3258,have you seen him ?,3.0,3.1,3.1
3259,"here , man ?",3.1,2.7,3.0
3260,i havent had a vampire here since you and nepthys shot a wicked look at him .,2.8,3.3,3.5
3261,"anyway , long time , man .",2.9,3.0,3.0
3262,thats odd .,2.5,3.3,3.2
3263,"on the dance floor , people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air .",3.5,3.4,3.2
3264,do you mind if we check it out anyway ?,3.0,2.9,3.3
3265,i have a real feeling that hes in here somewhere .,3.0,3.1,3.0
3266,"dvorov glanced over his shoulder , a little nervous .",2.44,3.33,2.33
3267,well be in and out in a minute .,3.0,2.63,3.0
3268,nepthys stepped in and dvorov walked us towards the dance floor .,3.1,3.2,3.0
3269,dvorov asked us .,3.0,2.88,3.0
3270,"no , he said that his research was purely academic , not for hunters .",3.0,3.0,3.0
3271,bummer .,2.11,3.22,2.78
3272,"i guess i probably shouldve known , though .",2.25,2.75,2.5
3273,"i mean , he is kinda tight about that stuff .",2.9,3.0,3.2
3274,he didnt look very surprised .,2.4,2.6,2.9
3275,"anyway , this is the dance floor , man .",3.1,3.1,3.2
3276,good luck .,3.6,3.1,3.1
3277,then i saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking .,3.1,3.2,3.5
3278,"i danced with rachel for a while , but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes .",2.9,3.2,2.9
3279,i tried to slip along the edge of the crowd .,2.88,2.75,2.88
3280,"things with scales and claws kept flailing against me , pressing me into the wall , but i took a breath and kept moving .",2.5,3.7,3.1
3281,my nose filled with a reek of thick sweat .,2.38,2.87,2.87
3282,"the music began to build , and a strobe came on .",3.25,3.25,3.38
3283,"somewhere toward the center of the dance floor , i heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing for a second , i was back with my family in russia , hiding from the cold .",2.6,3.5,2.4
3284,then i felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that amy was following me .,3.17,2.83,3.33
3285,i gathered her under my arm .,3.1,2.8,3.4
3286,"dvorov was somewhere behind me , too , negotiating delicately through his patrons .",3.1,2.8,2.9
3287,it slumped to the floor and i realized that it was a werewolf .,2.63,3.5,2.88
3288,its haunches twitched in time to the music .,3.2,3.1,3.0
3289,"as it started to rise , a man with thick , scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him .",2.88,3.38,3.38
3290,she told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd .,3.0,2.88,2.88
3291,i thought that my odds were better on the dance floor .,3.2,3.1,3.1
3292,"holding amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers , i started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this .",3.0,3.3,2.8
3293,"a cold thing with countless , writhing tentacles fell against me , thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose , tripping me and clutching at my limbs .",2.73,3.0,2.91
3294,"a woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me , fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing .",3.0,3.25,3.0
3295,"the creature blocking my vision moved back , but i had seen all that i needed to see .",3.12,3.12,3.25
3296,"a bleeding , eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me , but i ducked around it and toward the bar .",2.7,3.3,3.1
3297,"when she hadnt come back halfway through the next song , i glanced over at the bar .",3.0,3.0,2.87
3298,"i slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before , a mountain of wet , veined flesh , and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm .",2.3,3.5,2.6
3299,he pulled my ear down to his mouth .,2.8,3.5,2.7
3300,"you seen enough , man ?",2.7,3.3,3.3
3301,he shouted .,2.4,3.8,3.2

3314,"it was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share , mostly beer .",3.1,2.9,3.0
3315,its a dumb idea .,2.38,3.0,3.25
3316,"even if you did find this vampire cat , hed tear you apart !",2.7,3.7,3.2
3317,"suddenly , amy screamed .",2.0,3.71,2.43
3318,i whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock dvorov away .,2.71,3.71,3.29
3319,"his eyes were glowing red , and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off .",2.5,3.4,2.8
3320,the dancers near us tried to clear some space .,2.9,2.8,3.0
3321,"he shot back up , hardly touching the ground , and i kicked him back .",2.75,3.5,3.0
3322,"he jumped at my arm while i was still off-balance , and i felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that its too late to save itself .",2.9,3.2,3.2
3323,nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand .,2.8,3.4,2.9
3324,"he wasnt the only one with a secret or two ,",3.1,3.1,3.1
3325,"he wasnt the only one with a secret or two , he said by way of explanation .",2.8,2.9,2.9

3327,"i bet his hide-out is nearby , too .",3.0,3.0,3.2

3329,"rachel was standing with a plastic cup , looking like she was having a conversation , but i couldnt see anyone else there .",2.9,3.0,2.8
3330,he wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip .,3.0,2.88,3.0
3331,the crowd parted for us .,3.2,2.9,3.2
3332,the vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us .,2.8,3.6,2.6
3333,"in a blink of the strobe light , he was on his feet and dashing from the room .",3.2,3.3,3.1
3334,come on !,2.75,3.5,3.38
3335,shouted nepthys .,3.2,3.2,3.4
3336,"we chased after him , amy keeping up valiantly behind us .",2.8,3.4,3.1
3337,"he bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall , and we chased up after him , heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held .",2.62,3.75,3.12
3338,"luckily , the vampire turned off after three stories .",3.1,3.2,3.2
3339,"he ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors , but nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me .",3.0,2.8,3.0
3340,i called out to amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us .,2.75,3.37,3.25
3341,inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for dj equipment .,3.0,2.88,3.0
3342,"nepthys urged me on from the back of the room , then made a turn out of sight .",3.1,3.4,2.8
3343,"when i came to the door at the end of the room , it looked like it had been torn off its hinges .",2.6,3.5,2.7
3344,"i didnt imagine that nepthys had done it , and it wasnt without alarm that i ran after him .",2.44,3.44,3.33
3345,"the vault rose into obscurity above me , and a massive rose window stood ahead of me .",3.0,3.2,3.1
3346,"the panes looked dyed black , and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter .",2.82,2.73,3.0
3347,"when i asked her if she 'd ever seen them before i was old enough to stop believing , i mean she would always look sad and tell me , `` no , not since the family came to america has anything happened to us .",2.71,2.71,3.0
3348,"on the steps in front of the altar , i saw pale forms and realized that they were rachel and two other women .",2.9,3.3,2.9
3349,"he stood in front of a blue light , so i couldnt see him clearly , but what i saw was memorable .",3.2,3.4,3.1
3350,"then i heard nepthys shout , nathan !",2.9,3.7,3.4
3351,nathan !,3.27,4.0,3.18
3352,behind you !,2.8,4.1,3.4
3353,"i whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head , leaping like a panther .",2.8,3.3,3.0
3354,"there was nepthys , on the other side of the pews , holding the wooden box in his hand .",3.22,2.78,3.11
3355,"he tossed it to me , and i just barely had it open before i saw the vampire again , turning to face me .",2.8,3.4,2.9
3356,i pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes .,3.22,3.22,3.33
3357,"he leapt over the pews , soaring like a grasshopper , and drew a gleaming knife in midair .",2.75,3.12,2.88
3358,"i dodged , but he tossed it , and i held the box in front of my face .",2.8,3.1,3.0
3359,"the blade lodged in the wood , its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin .",2.62,3.5,2.63
3360,my arms shook from the force of his throw .,2.4,3.4,2.5
3361,then he landed heavy beside me and i scrambled to stand .,2.6,3.4,2.8
3362,"his first move pulled out the dagger , almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as i held on to the box , and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards .",2.5,3.12,2.37
3363,"he wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet , and his hair gleamed black against his white skin .",3.4,3.2,3.1
3364,"i dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer , ready to drive the ash spike into his heart .",2.75,3.37,3.37
3365,"behind him , i saw nepthys running between the pews .",3.0,2.9,3.2
3366,i braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me .,3.0,3.63,2.62
3367,i raised the stake ; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine .,2.3,3.8,2.3
3368,"the stake went down , there was a blur , and then my hands were empty and i felt pain under my jaw .",2.11,3.33,2.67
3369,"two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant , then all went numb .",2.4,3.2,2.7
3370,"my mind began to dissipate , but then i felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said , this ones blood isnt worth drinking .",2.71,3.29,3.0
3371,this ones blood isnt worth drinking .,2.6,3.1,3.2
3372,hands closed on my neck and i felt my spine crack .,1.9,3.8,2.0

3374,"i could perceive nepthys sword flashing over me , and i heard steel crack , then bone .",2.38,3.25,2.62
3375,"the blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor , setting off his striking face without illuminating its details , and his wrists flashed white in the darkness .",2.9,3.1,3.0
3376,i thought i heard rachels voice blearily calling for me .,2.75,3.0,3.0
3377,then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar .,2.9,2.8,2.9
3378,"i was content to let myself drift away , and i had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedrals hard tiles when i felt a warm touch on its cheek .",2.7,3.3,3.1

3385,"i stepped up behind him and raised my hands , which almost seemed to be glowing .",3.3,3.4,3.3
3386,"then the stake came down into his back and one , two , three strikes with the hammer drove it in .",2.3,3.5,2.7
3387,the vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth .,2.38,3.38,2.62
3388,"behind me , amy was kneeling beside nepthys , whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug .",3.0,2.71,3.0

3455,"jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries , and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work .",2.7,3.2,3.0
3456,"on a worldwide scale , newer materials such as aluminum , plastic , and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad .",3.0,2.57,3.0
3457,"steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline , and it affected both domestic and foreign companies .",2.7,3.1,2.8
3458,"however , to american companies already suffering financial setbacks , outdated machinery , and fierce competition , this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford .",2.3,3.1,2.8
3459,"since this problem was a national one rather than a local one , the problems that were occurring in youngstown were not unique .",3.0,3.0,3.0
3460,"youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry , but it was not alone .",2.2,3.4,2.6

3466,"eventually , some religious leaders involved in the ecumenical coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the save our valley campaign .",3.18,3.0,3.0
3467,"as the name suggests , local leaders wanted to instill the people of youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency , driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region .",3.11,3.22,3.33
3468,the events that would follow this date ( known as black monday ) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope .,2.8,2.7,2.7
3469,"marches , speeches , and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the campaign and rally the people .",3.2,3.1,3.2
3470,but the campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding .,2.6,2.7,2.9
3471,"people outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills , and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds .",2.8,2.7,2.9
3472,"the lack of money proved to be crippling , because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively .",2.78,3.0,3.11
3473,"without funds , the save our valley campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the citys dying economy .",2.4,2.8,2.8

3482,"however , it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight , the international branch was not .",3.1,2.8,2.8
3483,"the higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with youngstown and its plight , attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening .",2.4,3.2,3.3
3484,"no one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before , and none of the leaders of uswa , not even president lynn williams , knew what could be done .",2.9,2.9,2.8
3485,"it was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in us history , and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered .",2.5,3.2,2.6
3486,"besides incompetence , the uswa had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart : fear of socialism .",2.5,2.9,2.9
3487,"obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action , but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism .",2.8,3.0,3.1
3488,"if the uswa supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories , then the government ( and potentially other important people and institutions as well ) might begin to think that the uwsa leaders were encouraging socialism .",2.75,3.12,3.25
3489,regionalism,3.0,2.6,3.0
3490,from its very first days the mahoning valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets .,3.1,3.0,2.9
3491,"youngstown is the name of the major city area , but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself .",3.0,3.0,2.9
3492,"petitions , protests , rallies , collectivization , and even the takeover of a steel companys headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had .",2.44,3.0,3.0
3493,"boardman , poland township , struthers , lowellville , warren , lordstown , canfield , niles , and many other towns and districts are crowded around youngstown ( see figure 3 ) .",2.8,2.9,2.9
3494,"people from each town work , shop , eat , and socialize in towns separate from their own , making each town strongly dependent on every other town .",3.0,3.0,3.1
3495,"however , although traffic is heavy between each separate district , each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity , educational system , heritage , history , and even food .",3.1,3.1,3.0
3496,"for example , struthers is a poor town with a large slovak population , where education is generally better than in surrounding towns , but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread .",3.0,2.7,3.0
3497,most people in struthers are either orthodox or baptist .,3.0,2.78,3.11
3498,"two blocks over one finds boardman , a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools .",2.7,2.9,3.1
3499,"its residents are mainly italian and roman catholic , with a small concentration of methodists on the east side .",3.0,3.1,3.2
3500,"with many more cultures , religions , and economic levels living in close proximity to one another , a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area : regionalism .",3.0,2.5,2.6
3501,"each town , with their own identity , instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations , which dictates many habits , exchanges , and interactions between populations .",3.1,2.7,3.1
3502,"oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred , with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others .",2.2,3.2,2.7
3503,"with so much regional tension , it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause , even one that would save their jobs and their futures .",2.62,2.88,3.0
3504,"workers from poland township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from campbell , and citizens of struthers would become suspicious of people from boardman , even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing .",2.78,3.11,2.89
3505,"a lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement , because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together .",2.75,3.25,3.0
3506,"in some instances , small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area , but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate .",2.88,3.0,3.12
3507,in this way the people of the mahoning valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride .,2.9,3.2,2.8

3509,conclusion : the aftershock and the significance of black monday,2.9,2.8,2.7
3510,black monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people .,2.0,3.72,2.86
3511,"the efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons : the failure of the international steel market , the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the save our valley campaign , the refusal of the uswa to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear , and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies .",2.7,3.2,3.0
3512,"what happened in youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level , and perhaps it is not .",2.9,2.9,3.1
3513,"but to the thousands of people living there , the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic , political , and social futures .",2.6,3.0,3.0
3514,"because of the mills and their conspicuous absence , hundreds of people were uprooted , forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities .",2.3,3.2,2.7
3515,"hundreds more joined the unemployment lines , or even began living on the streets .",2.63,3.12,2.75
3516,"the steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves , something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on .",3.1,3.2,3.3
3517,"even though they eventually failed , the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children .",3.1,3.2,2.9
3518,but why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail ?,2.75,2.87,2.75
3519,"when examining the areas history , culture , and economic situation we can identify four main reasons : the refusal of the international leadership of united steelworkers of america to support their unions youngstown branch , the lagging international steel market , the lack of a clear , organized vision for individual initiatives such as the save our valley campaign , and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region , all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry .",2.63,3.12,3.0
3520,"most importantly , the problem in youngstown was a nationwide problem .",2.5,3.37,3.25

3523,"their blast furnace , hopewell , was the very first blast furnace in the area .",2.89,2.89,3.11
3524,"during the civil war , youngstown played a vital role in supplying the union army with iron products .",3.11,2.56,3.11
3525,"youngstown also was a major railway crossroads , due to its strategic position between cleveland , pittsburgh , new york , and chicago .",2.89,3.0,3.0
3526,the decline of the northeastern ohio steel market : why did attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail ?,2.5,3.2,3.1
3527,"in fact , more rail cars passed under the center street bridge [ a major bridge in youngstown ] per day than any other location in the country .",3.1,3.0,3.0
3528,"during the 19th century , the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far east coast ( massachusetts and eastern pennsylvania ) to the ohio valley pittsburgh regions of the northeast , including the mahoning valley and the hanging rock region of ohio and kentucky .",3.0,3.0,3.0
3529,"by 1880 , youngstowns population had grown to nearly 16,000 , which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period .",3.11,2.89,3.11
3530,"the town continued to prosper , driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills .",3.4,3.0,3.0
3531,"this prosperity continued until the late 1920s , when the great depression hit the area hard .",2.62,2.63,3.38
3532,"despite the congress of industrial organizations successful efforts to establish a national steel workers union , the industry barely survived the depression years .",2.7,2.7,2.8
3533,"finally , the outbreak of the second world war made iron and steel important again , and youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth .",3.3,3.1,3.1
3534,"strikes racked the town during the forties , fifties , and sixties , and they were often long and bloody .",2.6,3.2,2.7
3535,"this prohibited strikes and lockout , angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down .",2.44,3.11,2.89
3536,"at the same time , stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market american steel parts , and the overeager shareholders in the companies stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie .",3.1,2.8,2.9
3537,"most importantly , youngstowns steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive .",2.6,2.7,2.8

3541,meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement .,3.0,3.17,3.33
3542,"however , it was clear that , in the words of uswa president lloyd mcbride , if you cant make a buck , you get out of the business .",3.0,3.3,3.1
3543,"on that date jennings lambeth , president of youngstown sheet and tube company , announced that most of the steel companys campbell works would close .",2.2,3.4,2.8
3544,"if you cant make a buck , you get out of the business .",2.75,3.12,3.5
3545,"the closings meant the end of youngstowns only real industry , the end of its population growth , and then end of economic progress .",2.75,3.0,2.87
3546,"without the mills , people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country .",2.8,2.9,2.7
3547,those that could afford to move did so ; those that couldnt afford to move mostly ended up on the streets .,2.67,3.22,2.89
3548,"without an industrial or a residential base , commerce shrank considerably .",2.33,3.0,2.89
3549,"it was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills , the city of youngstown would soon become a ghost town , inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape .",2.4,2.9,2.7

3552,"the very first thing that the workers could do was to get up a petition to stop the shutdown , says ed mann , a local union leader and organizer .",2.9,2.7,3.0
3553,"the international chapter of the uswa had much more lobbying power , but they refused to support the local union members .",2.86,3.0,3.29
3554,the petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure .,2.5,2.8,3.0
3555,"next , workers decided to form the ecumenical coalition , an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the youngstown works .",3.14,3.0,2.86
3556,"although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback , for the people of youngstown and the surrounding area , it meant disaster .",2.43,3.43,2.57
3557,"lykes ignored the letters , so the coalition turned once again to the federal government .",2.75,2.75,3.38
3558,"here , too , they were ignored .",2.2,2.9,2.7
3559,"the coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills , so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed .",2.7,3.0,2.5
3560,"finally , following the shutdown of us steels plant in 1980 , local union leaders congregated outside the us steel headquarters in youngstown .",2.9,3.2,3.1
3561,"they invited local people and politicians to witness the scene , then charged the headquarters and took it over .",3.1,2.9,3.2
3562,"the workers stayed there until the next day , when us steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill .",2.78,3.0,3.0
3563,"immediately after the workers left the building , us steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill .",2.63,3.0,3.37
3564,"all these efforts eventually came to nothing , and youngstowns steel mills remained closed .",2.25,2.88,2.62
3565,"in fact , american steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports .",2.86,3.14,3.29

4687,"allan 's thoughts fled as one , scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume .",3.0,2.86,3.14

4697,"a mass of flaming wood stood before him , heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house .",2.67,3.56,2.78

4699,"it was a moment before he realized what else had changed : near the wall , beneath his window , was a stump with black and ancient bark .",2.9,3.1,3.1

5505,"however , it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many mayans to assimilate , as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility , and a belief among the general population that mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution ( warren 2002 : 159 , 172 ) .",3.0,2.6,3.0
5506,illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the mayan language itself : those who speak spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak mayan alone ( england 2003 : 733 ) .,2.9,3.0,2.9
5507,"nonetheless , in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages , which while reaffirming spanish as the official language , recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion .",3.0,3.0,3.0
5508,"within the pan-mayan movement , there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity : some view the reduction of their language to the status of `` dialect '' devalues their unique identity and place in the mayan world ; however , despite differences over standardization , the pan-mayan movement itself is largely cohesive .",3.0,3.0,3.14
5509,"an example is the tukanoans : while considered a single ethnic group , they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy , in which members of one language group must marry into another ( jackson 1995 : 4 ) .",3.2,3.1,3.0
5510,language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant western culture .,3.1,3.0,3.2
5511,"indigenous cosmology , or cosmovision , is difficult to translate into romanticized languages ; it maintains a concept of culture , defined as the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with nature ( gow and rappaport 2002 : 58 ) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with western modes of thought .",2.9,2.7,3.0
5512,"conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed , often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations .",3.0,2.86,3.0
5513,the differences between western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves : the question of embracing western law and discourse is continually grappled with .,2.9,2.9,2.9
5514,"language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity , particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in latin america has . in particular i will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases , that of the maya in guatemala and the nasa and guambiano peoples of colombia .",3.11,3.33,3.22
5515,"customary law in colombia contrasts with western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships : tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony , crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community 's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime , but may have influenced the accused to do so .",2.7,3.0,2.9
5516,"when a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out , the group feels the effects as a whole .",2.57,3.0,3.0
5517,"shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence , sharing in their ordeal .",3.0,2.91,3.09
5518,"( rappaport 2005 ) once punishments are completed , the criminal is seen as rehabilitated , having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order , and is welcomed back into the community ( gow and rappaport 2002 : 61 , rappaport 2005 : 97 ) .",3.0,2.9,3.0
5519,"translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task , as western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision .",2.9,2.9,3.0
5520,"the translation of the colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms , as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution , but to recapture its spirit in a native , rather than western discourse ( gow and rappaport 2002 : 58-59 ) .",3.2,3.0,3.1
5521,"this provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the spanish colombian culture , and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing ( rappaport 2005 : 93 , 236 ) .",2.9,2.8,3.2
5522,"translation fulfills another vital role , as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself .",3.25,2.87,3.12
5523,"workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge , distancing them from the western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries .",2.88,2.75,3.0
5524,the guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature ; mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten ( rappaport 2005 : 165 ) .,2.9,2.8,2.9
5525,this attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use .,2.9,2.5,2.9
5526,"difficulties arise , however , as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and spanish develop .",2.8,2.9,3.0
5527,"many native peoples in colombia are monolingual spanish speakers , raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use .",2.9,3.1,2.9
5528,"the authenticity of the modern nasa , who are often metropolitan spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots , is brought into question by the traditional , who speak nasa yuwe and lead a rural existence ( rappaport 2005 ) .",2.8,2.7,3.2
5529,"in guatemala the fact remains that spanish is the gateway to social mobility ; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one , and those literate in spanish have the tools to do so .",3.1,3.1,3.1
5530,"illiteracy and poverty is associated with maya ; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions , which most often occurs under spanish influence .",2.89,3.0,3.11
5531,"a further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic indianness , both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside spanish culture .",2.9,2.8,3.0
5532,"politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly , even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking spanish ; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself .",2.9,2.9,3.1
5533,"efforts towards development , then , can not endanger traditional culture and values , for fear of losing cultural legitimacy ( jackson 1995 : 5 ) .",3.0,2.7,2.7
5534,"there develops a duality in native culture ; for example , many nasa children receive instruction in nasa yuwe yet converse in spanish outside the classroom .",3.1,2.8,2.8
5535,this intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed .,2.9,2.6,3.1
5536,"in colombia , legal successes have often come about due to the colombian government 's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights ; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife , and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not ( jackson 1995 : 8 ) .",3.0,3.0,2.9
5537,"regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status , indigenous peoples in colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws ( jackson 1995 : 5 ) .",3.0,2.88,3.38

5540,the effects of spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries .,2.86,2.86,3.14
5541,"one of the most prominent , lasting influences is that of the land grant system . initially the spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system , in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land .",2.9,2.7,2.8
5542,"this was in turn replaced by the repartimento ; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the spanish , providing labor and taxes as demanded .",2.9,3.2,3.0
5543,the impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the marxist movements of the early 20th century .,3.29,3.14,3.0
5544,"those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations ; previously , both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant spanish culture .",3.1,3.0,3.2
5545,"however , they also claimed that they were part of a larger group , the working class , whose poverty was a direct result of american imperialism ; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one ( jackson 1995 : 6-7 ) .",3.11,3.22,3.22
5546,in colombia this resulted in a civil war between the liberal and communist parties and conservative party .,2.4,2.9,3.0
5547,"a truce established between the liberals and conservatives failed to meet the demands of the communists , who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response .",2.4,3.2,2.8
5548,"this process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture : a group of people joined by characteristics , traits , and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity , discernible from that of those outside them , those who do not belong .",3.09,2.91,3.0
5549,"this resulted in persecution against the mayans , who make up about 60 % of the overall population . in both counties , guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples ; in many cases there were coalitions , but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote , inaccessible villages as hideouts .",2.6,3.1,3.2
5550,"in guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed , 200,000 mayans were killed , and over 1 million more were displaced .",2.2,3.1,3.1

5552,"by the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen , and indigenous rights movements formed ( warren 2003 : 174 , jackson 2002 : 82 ) .",2.9,2.8,3.1
5553,central to these was the question of indigenous identity :,3.0,2.8,2.9
5554,"pan-mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the mayan language ; despite local dialectical differences , it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse mayan people .",3.1,2.9,2.9
5555,"most still speak it in various forms , and efforts by mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent , modern version of maya ( england 2003 : 733 , 739 ) .",3.1,3.1,3.1
5556,"pan-mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity ; it largely avoids specifically political overtones , instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging mayan culture ( england 2003 : 734 ) .",3.0,2.6,2.8
5557,"the popular left , however , continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool .",2.62,2.75,3.12
5558,"the pan-mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the ( often negative ) attention of the government ( england 2003 : 735 , warren 2003 : 181 ) .",2.9,3.3,3.1
5559,"naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing , food , lifestyle choices .",3.0,3.0,3.0
5560,"this results in part from the ingrained influences of spanish colonialism : spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility , whereas maya is seen as backward and inferior .",2.9,2.9,3.2
5561,"pan-mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to maya as it was in its classical renaissance , a language of power and prestige ( england 2003 : 736 ) .",3.0,2.83,3.0

5565,"the cric , which focuses on language development and renewal , is primarily representative of the nasa peoples ( jackson 2003 : 82 ) .",3.0,2.62,3.0
5566,"whereas the mayanists benefit from a single main identity , those of colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups ( jackson 2002 : 109 ) .",3.0,3.0,3.0
5567,"this reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities , both from the spanish colombian population and each other .",3.3,3.0,3.3
5568,"the command of a language , while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it , is often the key to gaining entry .",3.12,2.38,3.0
5569,"a major success in the colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991 , which includes a section on indigenous rights , as the congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups ( gow and rappaport 2002 : 57 ) .",3.12,2.75,3.12
