1484,I will include one example:,3.0,3.0,3.29
1485,"Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest.",2.88,2.75,3.0
1486,"Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds.",3.09,2.91,3.0
1487,"Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1488,This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.,3.1,3.0,3.3
1489,Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell.,3.0,3.1,3.2
1490,The code may look something like this:,3.0,2.4,3.0

1494,A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.,3.0,2.6,2.9

1517,"Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior.",3.1,3.1,3.1
1518,"Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors.",3.0,2.88,3.5
1519,The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.,3.14,3.14,3.14
1520,"It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest.",2.9,3.1,2.9
1521,"As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden.",2.9,2.7,3.1
1522,A program encoding this behavior might look like this:,3.0,2.88,2.88
1523,"These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems.",2.88,3.12,3.12
1524,"The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,2.7,3.1
1525,"Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest.",3.14,2.86,3.0
1526,"This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age.",3.0,3.11,3.11
1527,"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005).",2.88,2.75,3.12
1528,It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.,3.0,2.8,3.0
1529,"In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34).",2.88,3.0,3.0
1530,"Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60).",3.0,2.9,3.1
1531,"In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors).",3.0,3.2,3.1
1532,"To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones.",3.1,2.7,3.2
1533,"This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45).",3.0,2.9,2.9

1535,"Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1536,Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.,3.1,2.7,3.1
1537,"Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow.",3.0,3.0,3.1
1538,"An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1539,A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.,3.1,3.0,3.2
1540,Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):,3.0,2.5,3.0
1541,The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.,2.9,2.8,3.0
1542,"Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest.",3.0,3.0,3.0

1546,This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them.,3.0,2.62,2.88
1547,It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.,3.0,2.9,2.9
1548,"The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:",3.0,2.83,3.17
1549,"Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47).",3.0,3.14,3.29
1550,"To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon.",3.0,2.86,3.0
1551,The code might look like this:,3.0,2.8,3.1
1552,"An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is.",3.12,3.25,3.12
1553,"Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors.",3.1,2.9,3.1
1554,"Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work.",2.9,2.9,3.4
1555,"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot.",3.0,2.9,2.9
1556,"To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling.",3.0,2.9,3.1
1557,"The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002).",3.2,3.0,2.9
1558,"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler.",2.89,2.67,3.0
1559,"This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998).",3.0,3.0,3.0
1560,Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate.,3.0,2.8,3.3
1561,"According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue.",3.0,2.88,3.0
1562,"For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers.",2.88,2.75,3.0

1564,Conclusion,3.0,2.9,3.0
1565,"Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary.",3.2,3.3,3.2

1689,"However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant.",3.0,2.86,3.14
1690,"The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger.",3.1,2.9,2.9
1691,"This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.",3.0,3.1,3.2

1696,A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth.,3.0,2.38,3.0
1697,The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.,3.0,2.6,3.0

1702,The Development,3.18,2.73,3.0
1703,"As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections.",3.0,2.9,3.2
1704,"In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent.",3.0,2.88,3.0
1705,"As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise.",3.18,3.09,3.18
1706,"“is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”",3.0,2.75,2.88
1707,"For example, the fifth string quartet.",3.0,2.57,2.86
1708,"The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development.",3.0,2.9,2.9
1709,"Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”",3.0,3.0,3.0

1712,"Wilson, 182.",3.0,2.9,3.0
1713,"there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed.",2.88,2.75,3.5
1714,"Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1715,"Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme.",3.0,3.1,3.1
1716,"The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section.",2.86,3.0,3.29
1717,"Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1718,Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.,3.0,2.75,3.0
1719,"The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1720,This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section.,3.0,2.75,3.12
1721,"While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive.",3.0,2.8,3.2
1722,The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).,2.9,2.6,2.8
1723,This section is reproduced as Example 14.,3.0,2.88,3.0
1724,"This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section.",3.0,2.88,2.88
1725,"Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303.",3.0,3.11,3.33
1726,"The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯.",2.8,2.8,3.0
1727,"Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement.",3.0,2.82,3.0
1728,"As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition.",3.0,3.0,2.9
1729,"As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms.",2.7,3.3,3.2
1730,"The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17.",3.0,3.12,3.25
1731,The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16).,3.0,2.75,3.0
1732,"As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme.",3.0,3.12,3.0
1733,The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set.,3.0,2.7,2.8
1734,"The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center).",3.0,2.89,3.11
1735,"The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C.",3.0,2.44,3.22
1736,The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363.,3.2,2.8,3.2
1737,"The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation.",3.0,2.55,3.0
1738,"Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section.",3.0,2.88,3.0
1739,"Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1740,The Recapitulation,3.1,3.1,3.1
1741,"The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order.",3.0,2.6,3.0
1742,"The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1743,"It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1744,"The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G.",3.0,2.87,3.12
1745,"Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467.",3.1,3.1,3.3
1746,"E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme.",3.38,3.25,3.12
1747,"The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences.",3.0,3.0,3.22
1748,"Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale.",3.1,2.6,3.0
1749,"In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody.",2.91,2.82,3.18
1750,"In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1751,"Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different.",3.0,2.9,3.1
1752,"In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes.",3.1,2.8,3.1
1753,"In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement.",3.1,2.8,3.1
1754,"Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout.",3.1,2.9,2.9
1755,"See Wilson, 168-170.",3.0,2.8,3.0
1756,Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality.,3.12,3.25,3.12
1757,"While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work.",3.1,3.1,3.1
1758,"Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum.",3.2,3.1,3.2
1759,"But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results.",3.1,3.0,3.0

1768,"When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement.",3.0,2.9,3.1

1783,"The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece.",3.0,3.0,3.0
1784,"To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center.",3.0,2.9,3.0
1785,"The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale.",3.0,2.9,3.1
1786,"Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself.",2.9,2.5,3.1
1787,"The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive.",3.12,2.88,3.12
1788,"Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set.",3.0,2.63,3.37
1789,"Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths.",3.1,2.8,3.1
1790,Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.,2.9,2.9,2.9
1791,If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.,3.0,3.0,3.1
1792,"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯.",3.0,2.9,2.9
1793,"The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭.",3.1,3.0,3.1
1794,"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F.",2.8,2.9,2.9
1795,So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.,3.1,3.1,3.2
1796,"We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth.",2.9,2.9,2.9
1797,This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm.,3.0,3.0,3.1
1798,We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques.,3.0,2.86,2.86

1800,"Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples.",3.1,2.9,2.9
1801,"This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8.",3.0,2.9,3.0
1802,"So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole.",3.0,3.11,3.0
1803,"The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor.",3.0,2.71,3.0
1804,"This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor.",3.0,2.67,3.0
1805,"The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff.",3.0,2.9,2.9

1819,"White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work, for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains.",3.1,2.9,2.9

1831,Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.,3.0,2.86,3.14
1832,"Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so.",2.9,2.9,3.1
1833,This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man.,3.11,3.0,3.22

2405,"It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist, homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10).",3.09,3.0,3.0

2422,"In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3).",3.0,3.1,3.1

2433,"Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973.",3.0,3.2,3.2

2439,"Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics.",3.0,3.0,3.0
2440,"For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment).",3.0,3.0,3.14

4176,I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me.,3.0,3.63,2.62

4324,"Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had.",2.5,3.0,3.0
4325,"Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism.",2.5,2.9,2.9
4326,"Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism.",2.8,3.0,3.1
4327,"If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism.",2.75,3.12,3.25
4328,"This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.",2.5,3.0,2.62

4352,Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people.,2.0,3.72,2.86
4353,"The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies.",2.7,3.2,3.0

4363,"When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry.",2.63,3.12,3.0

4392,"“If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”",2.75,3.12,3.5
4393,"The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress.",2.75,3.0,2.87

4395,Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.,2.67,3.22,2.89
4396,"Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably.",2.33,3.0,2.89
4397,"It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape.",2.4,2.9,2.7

4399,Attempts to Save the Mills,3.0,2.9,2.8
4400,"The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer.",2.9,2.7,3.0
4401,"“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”",3.1,3.2,3.2
4402,"The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.",3.2,3.2,3.3
4403,"However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry.",2.86,2.86,3.0
4404,"The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members.",2.86,3.0,3.29
4405,The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.,2.5,2.8,3.0
4406,"Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works.",3.14,3.0,2.86
4407,The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.,3.12,3.25,3.25
4408,"Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster.",2.43,3.43,2.57
4409,"Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government.",2.75,2.75,3.38
4410,"Here, too, they were ignored.",2.2,2.9,2.7
4411,"The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed.",2.7,3.0,2.5
4412,"Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown.",2.9,3.2,3.1
4413,"They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.",3.1,2.9,3.2
4414,"The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill.",2.78,3.0,3.0
4415,"Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill.",2.63,3.0,3.37
4416,"All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed.",2.25,2.88,2.62
4417,"These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.",2.75,2.88,2.88
4418,The Decline of the World Market,2.1,3.3,2.7
4419,The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.,2.6,2.9,2.9
4420,"In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports.",2.86,3.14,3.29
4421,"Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel.",3.1,3.0,3.1
4422,"Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.",3.0,3.0,3.0
4423,"Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often.",3.1,3.0,3.1
4424,"This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product.",2.78,3.0,3.0
4425,Foreign steel was also much cheaper.,3.0,2.88,3.12
4426,"Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive.",2.56,2.89,3.11

6855,Dear Ms. LastName,3.12,3.0,3.0
6856,"Over the past year, the Graduate School of Arts and Science has seen record level contributions from its alumni and alumnae to the School’s Annual Fund.",3.6,3.3,3.1
6857,"This response is a marvelous endorsement of the work of our students, faculty, and staff.",3.6,3.3,3.0
6858,"As you read the enclosed Dean 's Report and Request, I hope you will consider how your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund shapes the lives of its faculty and students as it makes an impact on the depth and breadth of their NYU experience.",3.4,3.1,3.3
6859,"However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172).",3.0,2.6,3.0
6860,Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733).,2.9,3.0,2.9
6861,"Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.",3.1,3.1,3.1
6862,"Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion.",3.0,3.0,3.0
6863,This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.,3.0,3.0,3.0
6864,"Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive.",3.0,3.0,3.14
6865,"In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves.",3.0,2.9,3.1
6866,"An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4).",3.2,3.1,3.0
6867,Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture.,3.1,3.0,3.2
6868,"Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought.",2.9,2.7,3.0

6870,The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with.,2.9,2.9,2.9
6871,"Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia.",3.11,3.33,3.22
6872,"Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so.",2.7,3.0,2.9
6873,Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity,3.1,2.9,2.9
6874,"When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole.",2.57,3.0,3.0
6875,"Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal.",3.0,2.91,3.09
6876,"(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97).",3.0,2.9,3.0
6877,"Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision.",2.9,2.9,3.0
6878,"The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59).",3.2,3.0,3.1
6879,"This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236).",2.9,2.8,3.2
6880,"Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself.",3.25,2.87,3.12
6881,"Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries.",2.88,2.75,3.0
6882,The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165).,2.9,2.8,2.9
6883,This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use.,2.9,2.5,2.9
6884,"Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop.",2.8,2.9,3.0
6885,"Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use.",2.9,3.1,2.9
6886,"The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought.",3.0,3.0,3.0
6887,"In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new.",3.0,2.78,3.22
6888,"The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005).",2.8,2.7,3.2
6889,"In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so.",3.1,3.1,3.1
6890,"Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence.",2.89,3.0,3.11
6891,"A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture.",2.9,2.8,3.0
6892,"The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).",2.7,3.1,2.8
6893,"Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.",3.0,3.1,3.0
6894,"Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself.",2.9,2.9,3.1
6895,The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.,3.0,2.88,3.12
6896,"Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5).",3.0,2.7,2.7
6897,"There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom.",3.1,2.8,2.8
6898,"An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67).",3.0,3.0,3.12
6899,This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed.,2.9,2.6,3.1
6900,"In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law.",2.9,3.1,3.2
6901,"In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8).",3.0,3.0,2.9
6902,"Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5).",3.0,2.88,3.38
6903,Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.,2.8,3.0,3.1
6904,Works Cited,2.9,2.9,2.9
6905,The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries.,2.86,2.86,3.14
6906,"One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.",2.9,2.7,2.8
6907,"This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded.",2.9,3.2,3.0
6908,"Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others.",2.89,3.22,3.22
6909,"In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.",2.8,2.9,3.1
6910,The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.,3.29,3.14,3.0
6911,"Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture.",3.1,3.0,3.2
6912,"However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7).",3.11,3.22,3.22
6913,In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party.,2.4,2.9,3.0
6914,"A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response.",2.4,3.2,2.8
6915,"Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.",2.4,3.0,2.9
6916,"This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong.",3.09,2.91,3.0
6917,"This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).",2.9,3.0,2.9
6918,"This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.",2.6,3.1,3.2
6919,"In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced.",2.2,3.1,3.1
6920,The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).,3.2,3.0,3.0
6921,The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.,2.8,3.1,3.1
6922,"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).",2.9,2.8,3.1
6923,Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:,3.0,2.8,2.9
6924,"Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.",3.1,2.9,2.9
6925,"Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).",3.1,3.1,3.1
6926,"Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734).",3.0,2.6,2.8
6927,"The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.",2.62,2.75,3.12
6928,It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .,2.91,2.73,3.18
6929,"The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).",2.9,3.3,3.1
6930,"A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.",2.86,3.0,3.0
6931,"Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices.",3.0,3.0,3.0
6932,"This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior.",2.9,2.9,3.2
6933,"Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).",3.0,2.83,3.0
6934,By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.,3.0,2.9,3.0
6935,"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language.",3.0,2.5,3.0
6936,"Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).",3.0,2.8,3.0
6937,One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.,3.0,3.0,3.33
6938,"The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).",3.0,2.62,3.0
6939,"It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).",2.75,2.88,2.88
6940,"Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109).",3.0,3.0,3.0
6941,The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).,3.0,3.0,3.0
6942,"This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.",3.3,3.0,3.3
6943,"The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry.",3.12,2.38,3.0
6944,"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.",2.7,3.1,2.9
6945,"A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57).",3.12,2.75,3.12
6946,Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.,2.9,2.6,3.1
6947,"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.",3.5,3.25,3.25
6948,"They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52).",3.0,2.6,3.0
6949,The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:,3.0,3.0,3.0
6950,"no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.",3.1,2.9,2.9
6951,In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.,3.1,3.1,3.1
6952,"The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).",3.0,2.6,3.1
6953,The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.,2.6,3.2,2.8
6954,Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).,3.27,2.64,3.27

7312,"The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal listing) was varied.",2.9,2.9,3.0
7313,"Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs.",3.0,3.0,3.09

7319,"In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale).",2.9,2.9,3.0
7320,"And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone--a 2008 survey on Dorthy.com found that 66% of the 2000+ adults polled had made resolutions at some point (though only 17% managed to keep them).",2.9,2.9,3.2

7324,"As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself.",3.0,2.7,3.1

7327,"If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals.",2.7,2.9,3.1
7328,"But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.",3.09,2.64,3.18
7329,"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study.",3.0,3.0,3.1
