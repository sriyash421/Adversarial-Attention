94,Your acceptance on loan from Mr Chang of bronze statues eagle and bronco buster for display in your Senate office under your offices policy of accepting the loan of home state artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules,2.6,2.8,3.3
95,Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr Chang to individuals your sister an employee and a friend in your home at Christmas on the mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 34,2.67,2.89,3.22

101,Justice James R Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion also written by Zazzali they believed the death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of Nelsons history of emotional disturbance,2.8,3.1,2.9

115,And in New York state there are even more adventuresgreat paddling destinations from Long Island to the Adirondacks,3.2,3.2,3.2
116,To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moores critics,2.6,3.1,3.2
117,Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum with completely false ideas,2.7,3.2,3.2
118,a Moore clearly states that before he came to Flint Heston gave an interview,3.14,3.29,3.29
119,After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston where he is asked about Kayla Rolland again clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRAs presence then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch entirely ignored by critics of the film who also mentions Hestons presence as notable and refers to the immediate reactions of people from all over America gun ownersgroups who according to him reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children much like spanking advocates react aggressively when antispankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating,2.3,3.4,3.2
120,In poor areas the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort,2.5,3.0,2.7
121,Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal,2.86,3.14,3.14
122,Statistics are Moores weakest point and it is surprising that his critics dont dwell on them longer,2.9,2.8,3.1
123,Thats because they know all too well that Moore is correct The United States have a far greater homicide rate both gun and nongun than most other first world countries,2.5,3.1,3.0
124,Thats right I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted in Canada,3.3,3.2,3.4
125,If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson there is nothing fraudulent about that,3.0,3.3,3.1
126,Similarly the main motivation for the crusades beyond the promise of wealth was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved,2.36,3.27,3.0
127,His next project has the working title Fahrenheit 911 The temperature at which freedom burns and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election,3.11,3.11,3.22
128,After all the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous recordholding documentary Roger Me by Michael Moore,2.89,2.67,3.0
129,This text is in the public domain,3.0,2.6,2.8
130,It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades,3.0,2.6,2.9
131,In an interview with the Wall Street Journal linked from your site an employee claims that the gun would have been normally picked up at another dealer,3.0,3.1,3.2
132,There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene,3.0,3.0,3.12
133,This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often and it also the most inaccurate,2.86,3.0,3.0
134,First the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly,2.56,2.89,2.67
135,I guess I dont see that specific connection because the missiles that youre talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us,2.6,3.4,3.2
136,Moore is not from Colorado his question is generic not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question,2.88,2.75,3.38
137,However critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollums response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant,2.7,3.0,3.3
138,The visual of a billboard and a narration is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together when in reality it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver,2.83,2.83,3.17
139,I should know,3.0,3.0,3.1
140,Just sayingit seems I have more life now then you have and we know how little I get out,2.6,3.3,3.4
141,I dont remember if youve made noises here before about turning these into a book but if you do youve got at least one reader,3.3,3.3,3.2
142,It may also be that I remember the scene of their writing which would have been in the old apartment ie the place I barely remember ever having lived in anymore,3.0,3.0,2.9
143,If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday night feel free to scan through my 2009 archives and tell me what you think should be included in the Best of post,3.0,3.1,3.2
144,That I can access detailed information about events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely,3.1,3.2,3.3
145,I remember him being ineffective and as it turns out he was,2.7,3.0,3.1
146,Now that I remember him which I didnt before I remember him as being the pitcher whod pitched for 1 the team the Mets faced to get to the 86 Series and 2 the one they faced in it,3.0,3.0,3.1
147,But burned out toward the end,2.6,2.6,2.8
148,Having given up on watching the actual sport mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers,3.1,2.9,3.0
149,Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae and to mimic this Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting stalks with which to both interact with other ants who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae and take in chemical information,3.0,3.1,3.0
150,Such a robot would allow for both longterm studies of antrobot interactions and studies of taskswitching in the robots,3.25,3.12,3.0
151,Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns Gordon 2002 and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest Gordon Greene 2003 Greene Gordon 2007,3.14,2.86,3.29
152,Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species Gordon 35,2.82,2.91,3.09
153,All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks with four of each type of receptor per stalk,3.0,2.75,3.12
154,These will be located in different places the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt,3.0,2.75,3.0
155,The Behavior,3.0,2.78,3.0
156,Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil,3.0,3.0,3.2
157,The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos et al,3.0,2.75,3.0
158,Innest navigation will be a function of the temperature read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source,3.2,2.9,3.0
159,Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers and localize the source of foododors and middenodors,3.1,3.0,3.2
160,When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate,3.0,3.0,3.0
161,In order to perform both of these functions Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zigzag fashion as harvester ants do Gordon 34,2.88,3.0,3.0
162,Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its age since last boot,3.0,2.9,2.9
163,The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation and the bump sensors will when depressed also initiate the escape function,3.0,3.3,3.1
164,Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos Moller Labhart Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000 consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers,3.0,2.75,3.12
165,The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest Upon each exit from the nest Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later,3.0,2.56,3.0
166,So the Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now under their policies,3.0,3.0,2.8
167,BACKGROUND September 11 2004,3.0,3.1,3.0
168,NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM,2.8,3.4,3.4
169,Beyond these two sources there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups,2.92,3.0,2.91
170,Before 911 terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals loosely linked by radical Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter the USA,2.9,3.1,3.0
171,Harmonic Structure and Form,3.2,2.7,2.9
172,As Example 10 shows the chords are moreorless in duple meter 48 and 28 with one hiccup occurring in the 58 measure,3.1,2.9,2.9
173,Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯ which fills in the wholetone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth,3.0,2.88,3.0
174,E♭ furthermore is not convincingly established as a dominantfunctioning tone at all,2.9,3.2,3.0
175,Hence measures 155210 constitute the bass progression BE♭D♭B the same stepwise descent E♭D♭ occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged,3.0,2.6,3.2
176,a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second headmotive of the firsttheme,3.0,2.75,3.0
177,Wilson 182,3.0,2.9,3.0
178,The second section of the development is in C♯ which is sometimes spelled D♭,2.9,2.6,2.8
179,Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293 preceded by A♭ major V in measure 285 suggests C♯ as tonal center the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303,3.0,3.11,3.33
180,The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12 transposed to begin on F and turns it into a fugato sequence reproduced in Example 17,3.0,3.12,3.25
181,In the recapitulation of this theme shown in Example 19 the first chord is an Fmajor chord and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody,2.91,2.82,3.18
182,The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group respectively,3.0,2.75,3.0
183,While tonality in this piece and in Bartók’s music in general is quite different from its classical interpretation we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonataform structure,3.1,2.8,3.0
184,Bartók has often applied a tonicdominant relationship to a pitchclass and its tritone partner and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet,2.9,2.9,3.1
185,The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movementin fact it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this sectionbut the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece,3.0,3.0,3.0
186,The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitchclass set and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale,3.0,2.9,3.1
