99,Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff,3.1,2.8,3.3
100,This is naive to the extreme Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence,2.6,3.0,2.9
101,we wanted to let the NRA know that we havent forgotten about Kayla Rolland,2.9,3.0,3.1
102,Why did Moore the masterful deveiver not edit this sequence out,2.7,3.2,3.2
103,You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology yet you have no problems changing it yourself,2.78,3.33,3.44
104,Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moores film is your subessay Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked,2.8,2.9,3.0
105,Virtually every child psychologist knows that motherchild bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities the awareness of the consequences of ones actions and the learning of conflict resolution by nonviolent means,3.11,3.33,3.0
106,Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring,2.7,3.1,3.2
107,Not surprisingly guncite too compares data from different years as I know from personal experience it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology,2.71,3.0,3.14
108,The gun control movement on the other hand distracts from the real causes of violence poverty paranoia the war on drugs and antisexuality,3.0,3.29,3.0
109,He asks us to look at what I a foreign citizen was able to do at a local Canadian WalMart,3.12,3.12,3.12
110,11 Hestons allegedly implied racism,2.71,3.0,3.0
111,Hestons answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful,2.2,3.0,3.0
112,The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics,2.5,3.3,3.1
113,Interactive fiction like video games on the other hand presents violence in a narrative context which may very well desensitize participants to said violence but no causative link has ever been proven,2.9,3.0,3.0
114,But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason,3.0,3.27,2.91
115,Critics have stated that this scene was staged but in the bank interview the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time,3.0,3.0,3.33
116,This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore,2.75,2.75,3.0
117,The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe,3.0,2.75,3.25
118,This is plausible but entirely irrelevant for the movie which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed,2.9,2.9,3.1
119,The dialogue goes as follows,3.0,2.38,3.0
120,It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication but in doing so they themselves have unlike Moore made many incorrect claims,2.8,3.0,3.3
121,First the from my cold dead hands part This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston,2.82,3.0,3.27
122,The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009,3.0,3.0,3.1
123,He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets stayed for 85 then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in 86 World Series,3.0,3.1,3.1
124,To ease Antie’s onboard memory requirements and processing capabilities and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand I propose a few global variables and subroutines,3.11,2.89,3.33
125,For a simple start the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed,3.0,3.0,3.12
126,Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis,3.0,3.1,3.1
127,Unfortunately as of yet no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society,2.6,2.9,3.0
128,Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the nalkene levels,3.0,3.1,3.1
129,The second behavior patrolling involves two subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling,3.0,2.7,3.1
130,It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling,3.0,2.8,3.0
131,Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again,3.1,2.7,3.1
132,It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counterclockwise,3.0,2.9,2.9
133,Of course what makes Antie an innovative robot is the taskswitching between these larger behaviors,3.1,2.9,3.1
134,To remind the reader this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited taskswitching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling,3.0,2.9,3.1
135,The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer et al 2006 and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers Gordon 2002,3.2,3.0,2.9
136,Conclusion,3.0,2.9,3.0
137,Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors sonar detectors and chemical emitters including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging,3.11,2.89,3.11
138,Sensors,3.0,3.0,3.0
139,In order to inform itself about its environment Antie will need a number of sensors,3.0,3.0,3.0

146,May God help us all,2.5,3.3,2.4
147,Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears,3.0,2.5,3.0
148,The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over,2.9,3.1,3.1
149,As we will later see this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation,2.86,3.0,3.43
150,Example 11 illustrates this structure,3.0,2.8,3.0
151,Wilson claims that C and E♭ are local dominants to F in this first section of the exposition,3.0,3.11,3.33
152,This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge,3.0,3.1,3.2
153,While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261264 as 6Z50 014679 identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence +5 2 +5 from the original motive,3.0,2.8,3.2
154,This section returns to the calm simplicity and tempo of the second section though apart from affect there are no references to that section,3.0,2.88,2.88
155,The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth but the first note is B♭ rather than C which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center,3.0,2.89,3.11
156,Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A which intensifies the arrival on A and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the largescale wholetone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section,3.0,2.88,3.0
157,In fact the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as IviV in F majorwhile we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation,3.0,3.0,3.0
158,To begin with the movement is in F,3.0,2.88,3.0
159,Beginning with the exposition the largescale progression of tonal centers is a wholetone descent from F to F represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2 while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph in a quasibass Anstieg,3.29,2.86,3.14
160,The middle pitch of the descent B acts as the dominant to F based on its symmetrical division of the wholetone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition,3.0,2.56,3.0
161,Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure,3.0,2.75,3.0
162,The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive,3.12,2.88,3.12
163,For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces,3.13,2.75,3.25
164,Thus said the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low,3.0,2.9,2.7
165,In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors such as white black and gray,2.9,2.8,3.0
166,Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness,3.0,2.86,3.14
167,It is the source of its profits Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas,3.25,2.75,2.75
168,At the same time in our modern society color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space,2.9,3.1,3.0
169,colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place,3.1,2.9,3.1
170,color is seen as corrupting intoxicating disorienting and in art has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch,2.56,3.0,3.11
171,color rests on the surface of an object it is superficial cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing,2.8,3.0,3.1
172,For Charles Blanc color also represents a kind of ruination color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization the nobility of the human spirit slowly heroically has lifted itself but back into which it could always slide,3.14,3.29,3.14
173,It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire and to desire is to lose control over oneself,3.4,2.9,2.9
174,Thus began the cult of the black and white,3.0,2.7,3.0
175,The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space,3.0,3.1,3.2
176,El Jefe said,2.88,2.88,2.88
177,They Honore Comfort and the Sonoma County Vintners point to the prestige that the Napa Valley designation carries,3.0,2.78,3.0
178,But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands Napa Valley in addition to simply Rutherford be placed on these wines,2.9,2.6,3.5

184,There was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted in a companys revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened requirements for 75 incounty fruit in order to remain legal in designating the wine as from Napa,2.75,2.75,3.12

196,To quote from HR 5034 not withstanding that the state or territorial law may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress the state law shall be upheld,3.0,3.0,3.0
197,not withstanding that the state or territorial law may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress the state law shall be upheld,3.0,3.0,3.2
198,This claim by the wholesalers that HR 5034 does not amend federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up misrepresentation,2.7,3.4,3.1
199,does not amend,2.71,3.0,3.14
200,one of those justifications the bill states is maintenance of the structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system,3.0,3.14,3.14
201,The state needs no justification to discriminate against outofstate retailers,2.78,3.11,3.0
202,Over half the states have been sued challenging their alcohol laws,3.0,3.1,3.2
203,The lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense safeguards that require a facetoface transaction needed for ID checks to buy alcohol In fact facetoface transactions are not needed for ID checks,2.9,3.2,2.8
204,State legislatures always have,2.86,2.86,2.86
205,After that the state legislatures in every state where litigation has affected badly crafted laws went about legislating a fix,3.1,2.7,2.9
206,But what is truly remarkable and likely a result of the wholesalers hubris stemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare is their willingness to misrepresent facts ignore the truth and mislead in their defense of HR 5034,2.86,2.86,2.86
